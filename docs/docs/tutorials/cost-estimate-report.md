description: A guide to Nebari's cost estimate tool
---

## Introduction

[Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/) is a tool that enables developers to analyze their cloud cost estimates using their Terraform templates. Nebari wraps the `infracost` command-line interface, which is free and open-source, to provide cost estimates for your Nebari deployments across major cloud providers.

In this tutorial you'll learn to generate a cost report for your Nebari deployment, which you can share with other users and groups through an Infracost link. You will also be looking into how Infracost can be configured on your local machine.

Infracost natively supports Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. For this tutorial, we will be using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) deployment to generate the cost report.

## Step 1- Setting up Infracost

1. To install the `infracost` command-line interface, run the following command on your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/infracost/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
   ```

   The script downloads the CLI based on your operating-system/architecture and installs it under `/usr/local/bin`.

2. After installation, you can verify `infracost` was successfully installed via the following command:

   ```sh
   infracost --version
   ```

3. Next, you'll need to configure the API key for Infracost to enable generating cost reports and dashboards. Nebari's cost estimate feature requires this API key. To generate the key, run the following command on your terminal:

   ```sh
   infracost register
   ```

4. You will then need to validate your API key with the following command:

   ```sh
   infracost configure get api_key
   ```

You are now ready to run the cost estimate tool.

## Step 2 - Generating the cost estimates

1. To generate the cost estimate, run the following command:

   ```sh
   nebari cost-estimate
   ```

The Nebari cost estimate tool will look for the `stages` directory within your deployment file structure and analyze the Terraform templates to generate a cost report. It will consist of two tables describing the cost and resources breakdown, a publicly-accessible Infracost dashboard URL, and additional documentation on the edge cases that the cost estimate tool currently misses.

The report should look something like this:

```sh title="Sample Infracost generated report"
         Cost Breakdown
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃               Name ┃ Cost ($) ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩

│  Total Hourly Cost │       XX │
└────────────────────┴──────────┘
           Resource Breakdown
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓
┃                         Name ┃ Number ┃

│         Total Detected Costs │      X │
│    Total Supported Resources │      X │
│ Total Un-Supported Resources │      X │
│   Total Non-Priced Resources │      X │
│ Total Usage-Priced Resources │      X │
└──────────────────────────────┴────────┘

Nebari relies upon node pools which is a usage resource that doesn't get captured in
the above report. A general node pool will always have one node running will add
an additional charge. Please check with your cloud provider to see the
associated costs with node pools.

 • Total Monthly Cost: The total monthly cost of the deployment of supported
   resources.
 • Total Hourly Cost: The total hourly cost of the deployment of supported
   resources.
 • Total Detected Costs: The total number of resources detected by Infracost.
 • Total Supported Resources: The total number of resources supported by
   Infracost.
 • Total Unsupported Resources: The total number of resources unsupported by
   Infracost.
 • Total Non-Priced Resources: The total number of resources that are not
   priced.
 • Total Usage-Priced Resources: The total number of resources that are priced
   based on usage.
```

You can share the URL of your Infracost dashboard `https://dashboard.infracost.io/share/XXXXXXXXXX`
across your team for better insights into your cloud costs breakdown.

:::note
The Infracost dashboards are enabled by default for users. This is done via the Infracost's `INFRACOST_ENABLE_DASHBOARD` environment variable, which is set `true` by default.
:::

You can run the Nebari cost estimate tool outside your Nebari directory by specifying the location of your deployment's stages directory:

```sh
# where your deployment stage directory is <path-to-stages>
nebari cost-estimate --path=<path-to-stages>
```

## A note on node pools costs

The cost estimate report is statically analyzed via Terraform templates stored in the `stages` subdirectory. The actual cloud costs are subject to change. Nebari relies upon node pools, a useful resource that doesn't get captured in the above report. A general node pool will always have one node running - which incurs in an additional cost.

For example, using a `m5.2xlarge` instance type on AWS for the general node pool (currently the default) will cost $276.84 additional per month. Please check with your cloud provider to see the associated costs with node pools.
