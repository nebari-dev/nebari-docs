## Introduction

Conda Store serves identical Conda environments in as many ways as possible by controlling the environment lifecycle. It ensures that the management, builds, and serving of environments is as identical as possible and seamless for the end users.

With Conda Store, you can track specific files or directories for changes in environment filename specifications, manage environments using a REST API, and have a command-line utility along with a web interface to fully capitalize on all its capabilities.

In this tutorial, we will be initializing a new environment on Nebari using Conda Store, looking into how we can install new Conda packages, manage multiple environments and also share the environment with other Nebari users.
