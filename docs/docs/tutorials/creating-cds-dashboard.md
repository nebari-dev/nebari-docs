# Create a dashboard with Panel and Deploy it with CDS Dashboards

# What is a dashboard?

Analyzing data provides us with insights. A dashboard stitches these insights together into a meaningful story.

Different tools and technologies can be used to create and deploy a dashboard. In this tutorial
we will be building a simple dashboard on _Nebari_ which can be shared with other users and groups via
[ContainDS Dashboards](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (CDS Dashboards).

Currently, CDS Dashboards supports `Panel`, `Bokeh`, `Voila`, `Streamlit`, and `Plotly`.
We will be using `Panel` in this tutorial to create a dashboard.

## Creating the dashboard

*Let's get our hands dirty*


- Create a notebook in your JupyterLab environment on Nebari with a name of your choice
- Select an environment from the select kernel dropdown (located on the top right: e.g. `dashboard`)
- Copy the code below to your notebook.

We can now execute the notebook and view our Panel dashboard as output right inside the notebook.
Making it super easy to rapidly prototype new dashboards. Once we are happy with what we've created,
we can move on to deploying it with CDS Dashboards.

The code below dives into creating a dashboard from insights.

##### Creating insights using `holoviews`, `panel` and `bokeh` as backend

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import holoviews as hv
from bokeh.models import HoverTool
from holoviews import opts
import panel as pn
hv.extension('bokeh')

# creating a sample dataset
data_trees = { 'species_name': ['live oak', 'pecan', 'bur oak', 'cedar elm'],
               'avg_diameter_inch': [20, 30, 40, 35]
             }

df = pd.DataFrame(data_trees)

# simple curve/line and bar plots
plot_bar = hv.Bars(df, 'species_name', 'avg_diameter_inch')
plot_curve = hv.Curve(df)

# creating hover tooltip
hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[("avg diameter", "@avg_diameter_inch"),
                            ("species", "@species_name")])
# plot customization
combine_plot = plot_bar.opts(tools=[hover]) + plot_curve.opts(line_dash='dashed')

# creating simple dashboard using panel
dashboard = pn.template.BootstrapTemplate(
           site="About ðŸŒ³",
           title="Species and more",
           main=[combine_plot]
           )
dashboard.servable()
```

# Step-by-step guide for building a CDS dashboard

Let's use CDS and publish this notebook, visit [CDS docs](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more details.
Click on the top left tab navigate to `file` > `Hub Control Panel` > `Dashboards`. Click on the button `New Dashboard`.

> Steps to create new dashboard and publish

- Add a dashboard name (mandatory)
- Add a short description (mandatory)
- Customise user permission (optional)
- Select the file source, for this tutorial we will select `Jupyter Tree` (mandatory)

**Details section**

- Select the framework of your choice, here we will select `panel` (mandatory)
- Select the conda environment, make sure it is same as Jupyter notebook environment (mandatory)
- In the `relative path` box, copy your notebook's path (example: `demo-dashboards/tutorial/insights.ipynb`) (mandatory)
- Click on the save button
- Select the instance size and save, a message should appear stating :- **The dashboard is starting up**

# Conclusion

We have a working dashboard now ðŸŽ‰  
All that is left to do is to copy the URL and send it to your colleagues!
