# Create a dashboard with `Panel` and deploy it with `CDS Dashboards`

## What is a dashboard?

Analyzing data provides us with insights. A dashboard stitches these insights together into a meaningful story.

Different tools and technologies can be used to create and deploy a dashboard. In this tutorial
we will be building a simple dashboard on Nebari which can be shared with other users and groups via
[ContainDS Dashboards](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (CDS Dashboards).

Currently, CDS Dashboards supports `Panel`, `Bokeh`, `Voila`, `Streamlit`, and `Plotly`.
We will be using `Panel` in this tutorial to create a dashboard.

## Creating the dashboard

_Let's get our hands dirty_

- Create a notebook in your JupyterLab environment on Nebari with a name of your choice
- Select an environment from the select kernel dropdown (located on the top right: e.g. `dashboard`)
- Copy the code below to your notebook.

Our dashboard will be creating insights using `Holoviews` and `Panel` with `Bokeh` as backend.

```python
import pandas as pd
import holoviews as hv
from bokeh.models import HoverTool
import panel as pn
hv.extension('bokeh')
pn.extension()

# creating a sample dataset
data_trees = { 'species_name': ['live oak', 'pecan', 'bur oak', 'cedar elm'],
               'avg_diameter_inch': [20, 30, 40, 35]
             }

df = pd.DataFrame(data_trees)

# simple curve/line and bar plots
plot_bar = hv.Bars(df, 'species_name', 'avg_diameter_inch')
plot_curve = hv.Curve(df)

# creating hover tooltip
hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[("avg diameter", "@avg_diameter_inch"),
                            ("species", "@species_name")])
# plot customization
combine_plot = plot_bar.opts(tools=[hover]) + plot_curve.opts(line_dash='dashed')

# creating simple dashboard using panel
dashboard = pn.template.BootstrapTemplate(
           site="About ðŸŒ³",
           title="Species and more",
           main=[combine_plot]
           )
dashboard.servable()
```

We can now execute the notebook and view our Panel dashboard as output right inside the notebook. This feature of Panel 
makes it very easy to rapidly prototype new dashboards.

Once we are happy with what we've created, we can move on to 
deploying it with CDS Dashboards.

## Deploying with CDS dashboards

Now we'll use CDS Dashboards to publish and share this notebook. You can visit the 
[CDS Dashboards docs](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more details on this great package.

To begin, click on the top left tab navigate to `File` > `Hub Control Panel` > `Dashboards`. Click on the button `New Dashboard`.

### Steps to create new dashboard and deploy

- Add a dashboard name
- Add a short description
- Customise user permission (optional)
- Select the file source, for this tutorial we will select `Jupyter Tree`
- Details section
  - Select the framework of your choice, here we will select `panel`
  - Select the conda environment, make sure it is same as Jupyter notebook environment
  - In the `relative path` box, copy your notebook's path (example: `demo-dashboards/tutorial/insights.ipynb`)
  - Click on the save button

* Selecting the compute resources

  * When we publish our dashboard, compute and memory resources are allocated. The instance size required
    will differ based on usecase. The instances seen on this selection screen will vary depending on your Nebari
    setup. 
  ![Instance selection](/img/select_instance.png)

  * Once the instance is selected, this will trigger the dashboard to begin building. You willl see the following 
  screen indicating that **the dashboard is starting up**.

If there are no errors encountered during this process, we will be automatically redirected to the dashboard!

:::note
- Please be aware that while the dashboard is running, it will continue to consume resources. You should be mindful
of the incurring on-going costs while the dashboard is running. 
:::

## Accessing the dashboard inside Nebari

Head to `File` > `Hub Control Panel` > `Dashboards` which lists all the dashboards published by you and your colleagues.

Here, you can find the URL of your dashboards which can be shared with other users. You can also control your 
deployment from this page. 

- In order to stop the dashboard server click on the `stop` button.
- To start the dashboard server click on the `start` button.
- To delete the server and the resources allocated click on the `delete` button.
- To make any changes to the existing CDS options, click on the `edit` button.

## Conclusion

We now have a working, shareable dashboard ðŸŽ‰  

All that is left to do is to send it to your colleagues!
