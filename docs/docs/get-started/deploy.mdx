# Choosing a deployment platform

Nebari can be deployed on any of the major public cloud providers, or on a pre-existing Kubernetes cluster.
Review the options below to determine which option best suits your needs.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div style={{'border-radius': '15px', 'border': '2px solid var(--ifm-color-background)', 'padding': '20px' }}>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Cloud-deployment-tab" label="Cloud" default>

The cloud deployment of Nebari is considered to be the default option. It enables teams to build and maintain a cost-effective and scalable compute/data science platform in the cloud, by using an [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) approach that streamlines the deployment and management of data science infrastructure.

If you are not sure which option to choose, a cloud installation is likely your best option. It is suitable for most use cases, especially if:

- You require scalable infrastructure

- You aim to have a production environment with GitOps enabled by default

- Your team does not have specific expertise within high-performance computing hardware, Kubernetes, Docker, and/or other cloud-native or scalable compute infrastructure technologies

:::note
The cloud installation is based on Kubernetes, but knowledge of Kubernetes is **NOT** required nor is in-depth knowledge about the specific provider required either.

Currently, Nebari supports [Amazon AWS][nebari-aws], [Google GCP][nebari-gcp], and [Azure][nebari-azure].

<TabItem value="local" label="Local deployment">

This approach is recommended for **testing and development** of Nebari’s components due to its simplicity. Choose the local mode if:

- You want to test your Kubernetes cluster
- You have available local compute setup
- You want to try out Nebari with a quick install for exploratory purposes, without setting up environment variables

You should choose another installation option, likely a [cloud install][supported-cloud-providers] if you are starting from scratch (you have no compute clusters already in place) and you desire to stand up a production instance of Nebari.

For instructions on installing and deploying Nebari Local, please visit [Deploying Nebari on a local machine](/docs/how-tos/nebari-local.md).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="existing" label="Existing infrastructure">

This approach is recommended if you have existing infrastructure and want to deploy Nebari on:

- **Pre-existing Kubernetes clusters** (EKS, AKS, GKE, or custom clusters)
- **Bare metal servers** using our K3s setup

Choose this option if:
- You have existing cloud-managed Kubernetes clusters (EKS, AKS, GKE)
- You want to deploy on bare metal infrastructure
- You're migrating from traditional HPC systems
- You need full control over your infrastructure

For detailed instructions:
- [Deploy Nebari on bare metal with K3s](/docs/how-tos/nebari-bare-metal.mdx) - Set up a K3s cluster on bare metal and deploy Nebari
- [Deploy Nebari on existing Kubernetes clusters](/docs/how-tos/nebari-kubernets.mdx) - Deploy on pre-existing EKS, AKS, GKE, or custom clusters

:::tip
The bare metal deployment using [nebari-k3s](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-k3s) provides a modern Kubernetes-based alternative to traditional HPC batch systems and replaces the deprecated nebari-slurm project.
