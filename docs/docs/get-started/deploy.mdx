# Choosing a deployment platform

Nebari can be deployed on any of the major public cloud providers, or on a pre-existing Kubernetes cluster.
Review the options below to determine which option best suits your needs.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div style={{'border-radius': '15px', 'border': '2px solid var(--ifm-color-background)', 'padding': '20px' }}>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Cloud-deployment-tab" label="Cloud" default>

The cloud deployment of Nebari is considered to be the default option. It enables teams to build and maintain a cost-effective and scalable compute/data science platform in the cloud, by using an [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) approach that streamlines the deployment and management of data science infrastructure.

If you are not sure which option to choose, a cloud installation is likely your best option. It is suitable for most use cases, especially if:

- You require scalable infrastructure

- You aim to have a production environment with GitOps enabled by default

- Your team does not have specific expertise within high-performance computing hardware, Kubernetes, Docker, and/or other cloud-native or scalable compute infrastructure technologies

:::note
The cloud installation is based on Kubernetes, but knowledge of Kubernetes is **NOT** required nor is in-depth knowledge about the specific provider required either.

Currently, Nebari supports [Amazon AWS][nebari-aws], [Google GCP][nebari-gcp], and [Azure][nebari-azure].

<TabItem value="local" label="Local deployment">

This approach is recommended for **testing and development** of Nebariâ€™s components due to its simplicity. Choose the local mode if:

- You want to test your Kubernetes cluster
- You have available local compute setup
- You want to try out Nebari with a quick install for exploratory purposes, without setting up environment variables

You should choose another installation option, likely a [cloud install][supported-cloud-providers] if you are starting from scratch (you have no compute clusters already in place) and you desire to stand up a production instance of Nebari.

For instructions on installing and deploying Nebari Local, please visit [Deploying Nebari on a local machine](/docs/how-tos/nebari-local.md).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="existing" label="Pre-existing Kubernetes cluster">

This approach is recommended if you are already using Kubernetes and want to deploy Nebari on your existing cluster.

For instructions on installing and deploying Nebari on an existing Kubernetes cluster, please visit [How to install and setup Nebari on an existing Kubernetes infrastructure](/docs/how-tos/nebari-kubernets.mdx).

:::note
As of now, we have only tested this functionality for AWS, but we are continuously working on expanding to other cloud providers.
