# Installing Nebari

<!-- TODO: Add link to advanced settings section -->

This installation guide provides the basic instructions to install and deploy Nebari for the first time, and assumes you are already familiar with the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) and [Python packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-packages) ecosystems. If you are already familiar with Nebari and would like information on advanced configuration options, skip to the advanced-settings section in this documentation.

:::note
This guide focuses on installing Nebari for **cloud usage**.

For other alternatives, visit the [Choosing a deployment platform][nebari-deploy] section for an overview of the available options and their respective installation steps.
:::

## Pre-requisites

Nebari heavily depends on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and Python. The installation of the Terraform binary is built-in within the Nebari source code, and it is automatically downloaded during the first execution. Currently, only `Linux` and `macOS` are supported. `Windows` is only supported through the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” ("WSL").

- Currently, Nebari supports `Python >= 3.8`
- For more details on Terraform and its dependencies, visit the [official Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- To install conda, visit the [official conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), or if you prefer, visit the [mamba installation documentation](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#installation)

## How to install Nebari

There are currently two ways to install Nebari:

1. You can install Nebari directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`. For most common architectures and platforms (`Linux x86-64` and `macOS x86-64`), `pip` will download and install the most recent version available.

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install nebari
   ```

2. Nebari is also available at [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nebari) and can be installed using the `conda` package manager by running the following command:

   ```bash
   conda install nebari -c conda-forge
   ```

   if you prefer [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#mamba), you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   mamba install nebari
   ```

## Verify installation

You can verify that the Nebari package is properly installed and you can execute the client commands by running:

```bash
nebari --help
```

## What's next?

### Nebari Init and Guided Init

Nebari Init creates and initializes your Nebari configuration. Guided init does the same but you can have a step-by-step experience while running it.

You can pass the `--help` flag to the `init` command to check all the arguments and options available for it.

```bash
nebari init --help
```

:::tip
You can pass the `--guided-init` flag to the `init` command to interact with Guided Init Wizard.
