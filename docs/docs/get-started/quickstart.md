This is a quick Nebari CLI reference. If you're new to Nebari, start at [Installing Nebari][install-nebari].

<div align="center">
  <img src="/img/get-started/nebari-cli-commands.png" alt="A diagram showing the different Nebari CLI commands. The first step is 'nebari init' which creates the 'nebari-config.yaml' file. The second step is 'nebari deploy' which deploys the Nebari instance on the cloud. The third step is 'nebari destroy' which destroys the deployed instance. These second and third steps run 'nebari validate' and 'nebari render' internally. 'nebari validate' verifies the 'nebari-config.yaml' file. 'nebari render' generates the 8-stage terraform deployment scripts." width="60%"/>

## Install

You need a MacOS or Linux machine with Python >= 3.8 to install Nebari.

You can install Nebari from PyPI or conda-forge:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="conda" default>

```bash
conda install nebari -c conda-forge
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip" default>

```bash
python3 -m pip install nebari
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mamba" label="mamba" default>

```bash
mamba install nebari
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation with:

```bash
nebari --help
```

<details>
<summary>Make sure it displays an output similar to:</summary>

```bash
usage: nebari [-h] [-v]
            {deploy,render,init,validate,destroy,support,upgrade,keycloak,cost-estimate}
            ...

Nebari command line

positional arguments:
  {deploy,render,init,validate,destroy,support,upgrade,keycloak,cost-estimate}
                        Nebari - 0.4.3

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Nebari version number
```

</details>

## Initialize

After installation, you can create a new Nebari project!

Create a new project directory:

```bash
mkdir <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Create the `nebari-config.yaml` file using the guided init wizard:

```bash
nebari init --guided-init
```

**Or**, if you know the initialization requirements and have set up the environment variables, you can directly run the `nebari init` command with the necessary flags.

:::caution Project naming conventions

In order to successfully deploy Nebari, there are some project naming conventions which need to be followed. Below we summarize the format requirements for the most common cloud providers:

- Letters from A to Z (upper and lower case) and numbers are allowed;
- Special characters are **NOT** allowed;
- Maximum accepted length of the name string is 16 characters;
- If using AWS names **SHOULD NOT** start with the string `aws`.

Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions which in some cases may be more restrictive or less restrictive than the ones listed above. For more information, refer to the `Initializing Nebari` section in the "How to Deploy ..." documentation for your chosen cloud provider.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gcp" label="GCP" default>

Download the service account key file for your Nebari project, and set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="path/to/JSON/file/with/credentials"
export PROJECT_ID="Project ID"
```

Create `nebari-config.yaml` with:

```bash
nebari init gcp --project projectname \
  --domain domain \
  --auth-provider password
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

Download the file with the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key provided by your IAM role, and set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="Access Key ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="Secret Access Key"
```

Create `nebari-config.yaml` with:

```bash
nebari init aws --project projectname \
    --domain domain \
    --auth-provider password
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="do" label="Digital Ocean" default>

Provide authentication credentials to Nebari by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=""          # API token required to generate resources
export SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""        # public access key for access spaces
export SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""    # the private key for access spaces
```

Create `nebari-config.yaml` with:

```bash
nebari init do --project projectname \
  --domain domain \
  --auth-provider password
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="azure" label="Azure" default>

Provide authentication credentials to Nebari by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=""        # application (client) ID
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=""    # client's secret
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=""  # Available at the `Subscription` section under the `Overview` tab
export ARM_TENANT_ID=""        # Available under `Azure Active Directories`>`Properties`>`Tenant ID`
```

Create `nebari-config.yaml` with:

```bash
nebari init azure --project projectname \
  --domain domain \
  --auth-provider password
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- TODO: Add commands for HPC and local cluster. -->

## Deploy

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="regular-deploy" label="Regular deploy" default>

You can deploy your Nebari instance to the cloud (selected in the previous step) with:

```bash
nebari deploy -c nebari-config.yaml
```

You may need to set up necessary DNS records (with a DNS provider of your choice) for your chosen domain to proceed if you see:

```bash
Take IP Address 12.312.312.312 and update DNS to point to "your.domain" [Press Enter when Complete]
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="auto-dns" label="Automatic DNS provision" default>

If you use Cloudflare, you can set up automatic DNS provisioning.

Create a Cloudflare API token and set the following environment variable:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="cloudflaretokenvalue"
```

Use the `--dns-auto-provision` flag with the Nebari `deploy` command:

```bash
nebari deploy -c nebari-config.yaml \
  --dns-provider cloudflare \
  --dns-auto-provision
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It can take up to 30 mins for the `deploy` command to execute.

## Destroy

To delete all your Nebari resources, while preserving the `nebari-config.yaml file`, run:

```bash
nebari destroy -c nebari-config.yaml
```

It can take up to 30 mins for the `destroy` command to complete.

:::tip
If you deployed Nebari on the cloud, verify if the relevant resources were destroyed and manually delete anything that was not destroyed.
:::

## Validate (optional)

After creating the `nebari-config.yaml` file, you can customize it. To ensure your customizations are valid, run:

```bash
nebari validate -c nebari-config.yaml
```

:::note
This command is automatically run when you `deploy`.
:::

## Render (optional)

You can generate the (Terraform) deployment workflow scripts with:

```bash
nebari render -c nebari-config.yaml
```

This is useful if you use a GitOps workflow with GitHub (or GitLab) Actions.

:::note
This command is automatically run when you `deploy`.
