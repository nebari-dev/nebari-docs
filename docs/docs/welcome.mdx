## Nebari Vision

An opinionated open source [JupyterHub][jupyterhub] distribution that provides
an all-in-one development and experimentation platform for teams to work
efficiently and collaboratively.

Deployment, integration, and maintenance is minimized by using the
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management approach.

## Nebari has a _DevOps for non-DevOps people_ approach.

### Components

The technology stack is an integration of the following existing open source libraries:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html): a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/): a cloud-agnostic orchestration system
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/): a package manager for Kubernetes
- [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub): a shareable compute platform for data science
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter Notebooks
- [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/): a scalable and flexible library for parallel computing in Python
  - [Dask-Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/): a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask clusters
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/): an open source identity and access management tool
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): a tool to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows in a GitHub repository.
- [traefik](https://traefik.io/): for routing web/tcp traffic inside cluster
  - [traefik-forward-auth](https://github.com/thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth): for single sign on and easy securing of web applications

Amongst the newly created open source libraries on the tech stack are:

- [Jupyterhub SSH](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh): brings the SSH experience to a modern cluster manager.
- [Jupyter Videochat](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyter-videochat): allows video-chat with JupyterHub peers inside JupyterLab, powered by Jitsi.
- [Conda Store](https://github.com/quansight/conda-store): serves identical conda environments and controls its life-cycle.
- [Conda Docker](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-docker): an extension to the docker concept of having declarative environments that are associated with Docker images
  allowing tricks and behavior that otherwise would not be allowed.
- [VS Code codeserver](https://github.com/cdr/code-server): built-in web editor tied to jupyterlab server

### Integrations

Nebari does all the heavy lifting of integrating with common services.

- [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) - workflow management
- [ClearML](https://clear.ml/) - machine learning experiment tracking and analysis
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - cluster monitoring
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - cluster monitoring visualizations
- [CDS Dashboards](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/) - shared dashboarding across users

## Why use Nebari?

Nebari enables teams to build their own scalable compute infrastructure with:

- Straightforward installation and maintenance controlled by a single configuration file.
- Autoscaling JupyterHub installation deployed on one of the supported Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, DO, or Azure).
- Option to choose from multiple compute instances.
- Autoscaling Dask compute clusters for big data using any instance type.
- Shell access and remote editing access (VSCode remote) through KubeSSH.
- Shared filesystem allowing users to work on projects privately, within groups, or across the organisation.
- Robust compute environment handling allowing both prebuilt and ad-hoc environment creation.
- Integrated video conferencing, using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/).
