If you are a data practitioner using Nebari for your day-to-day work, like data analysis, visualization, and more, the following path and pages will be useful for you.

🔸 [Log-in to your team's Nebari instance, launch your JupyterLab server](/docs/tutorials/login-keycloak), and use the IPython/Jupyter notebooks.

🔸 Learn to [create new environments (kernels) using conda-store](/docs/tutorials/creating-new-environments) if you need specific libraries.

🔸 If you need to scale your work, [leverage Dask and Dask Gateway for parallel and distributed computing within Nebari][using-dask].

🔸 Learn to [create and share interactive data visualization dashboards with your team][create-dashboards].


🔸 You can also [consider Visual Studio Code][using-vscode] if that is more convenient for your work.

If you are setting up Nebari and managing the platform for your organization or team, the following steps and pages will be helpful.

🔸 Begin with the ["Get Started" documentation section][get-started] that includes complete instructions to install and deploy your own Nebari instance.

🔸 The get started section will also take you to some "how-to guides" like the [deployment instructions for specific cloud-providers](/docs/get-started/cloud-providers) and [DNS provisioning](/docs/how-tos/domain-registry).

🔸 After setup, [provide your team members access to your Nebari instance by configuring Keycloak][configure-keycloak].

🔸 If you face issues or challenges, check out the [Troubleshooting section](/docs/troubleshooting) and [GitHub Discussions][github-discussions] to learn from the community. You can also look into [debugging your deployment](/docs/how-tos/debug-nebari).

🔸 As a good security practice, [create and keep a manual backup](/docs/how-tos/manual-backup) of your configurations and your team's work.

🔸 To get the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches, [upgrade your Nebari instance](/docs/how-tos/nebari-upgrade) regularly.

🔸 If or when you need to, you can [destroy the instance and all associated resources](/docs/how-tos/nebari-destroy).
