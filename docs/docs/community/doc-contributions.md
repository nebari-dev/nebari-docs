title: Contribute to Nebari's documentation
description: Guidelines for contributing to Nebari's documentation
---

A complete and accessible set of documentation is essential for an open source project's success. Thank you for making Nebari's documentation better!

Nebari has the following (broad) types of documentation:

- **Narrative documentation** in the form of tutorials, how-to's, and more, hosted on `nebari.dev` (this website). Keep reading this page to learn how you can contribute!
- **Docstrings and READMEs** that are a part of the [nebari codebase][nebari-repo] and other GitHub repositories in the [nebari-dev][nebari-org] respetively. To contribute to these, check out [Contribute to Nebari's codebase](doc-contributions.md).
- **Demos and examples** for community self-study and conference presentations hosted at [nebari/nebari-demo][nebari-demo]. To contribute examples, start at the [Nebari Demo README](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-demo#readme).

## Documentation style guide

We follow some style guidelines across the Nebari documentation resources to maintain consistency and keep our documentation accessible to everyone. Take a few minutes to go through the key principles before contributing. We encourage you to read the complete style guide when you get a chance. Many suggestions in the style guide are good practices to follow in regular written communication as well.

## Documentation tool

Nebari's documentation is built with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. You author documentation using a friendly Markdown format, that are converted to consistent documentation pages by Docusaurus. If you are not familiar with Markdown, check out ...

Docusaurs has some helpful special features like tabs and admonitions, go through the [Markdown Features section of the Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) to learn about them!

The deployment is automatically handled by Netlify when your content is merged into the `nebari-docs/main` branch.

## Set up your local repository

1. Make a fork of the [`Nebari-docs` repository][nebari-docs-repo] to your GitHub account
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nebari-docs.git
   ```

## Set up your local development environment
### Optional: Create an isolated environment

1. To create an environment with `conda`:

```bash
conda create -n nebari-docs python=3.9
```

:::note
You need Python 3.7 or higher to complete the setup.
:::

2. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate nebari-docs
```

### Prerequisites: Node.js

To build the site you will need to have Node.js installed. To see if you already have Node.js installed, type the following command into your local command line terminal:

```bash
node -v
# v18.10.0
```

If you see a version number, such as `v18.10.0` printed, you have Node.js installed, you can move to the next section!

If you get a `command not found` error (or similar phrasing), install Node.js before continuing.

To install node visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or check any of these handy tutorials for [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04), [Debian](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-debian-10), or [macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment-on-macos).

If you created an environment with `conda`, you can install Node.js with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

### Prerequisites: Yarn

Once you have Node.js installed you can proceed to install Yarn. Yarn has a unique way of installing and running itself in your JavaScript projects. First, you install the yarn command globally, then you use the global yarn command to install a specific local version of Yarn into your project directory.

The Yarn maintainers recommend installing Yarn globally by using the `NPM` package manager, which is included by default with all Node.js installations. Use the `-g` flag with `npm` install to do this:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

After the package installs, have the `yarn` command print its own version number to verify if it was installed properly:

```bash
yarn --version
# 1.22.11
```

### Installing documentation dependencies

1. Move to the `/docs` directory:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Pre-commit hooks

The `nebari-docs` repository uses a number of [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to standardize our YAML and Markdown structure.

:::note
You will need to have Python>= 3.7 installed in your local machine.
:::

1. Before you can run the hooks, you need to install the pre-commit package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip" default>

   ```bash
   python -m pip install pre-commit
   ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="conda" label="conda">

   ```
   conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
   ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Navigate to the root of this project. If you're in the `docs` subdirectory, you can run "`cd ..`" to go back to the root.

3. Install the git hook scripts:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. (Optional) Run the hooks against the files in this repository:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Once installed, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you make a commit in version control.

### Working on the docs

Once you have the pre-commit hooks and the dependencies installed, you can start writing and updating the documentation.

To see a live local version of the docs while editing, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

:::note
By default, this will load your site at <http://localhost:3000/>.

You can specify a different port with `yarn start --port <port-number>`.
:::

### (Optional) Building the site locally

You can build the static files of the documentation to see how they would look once deployed to `nebari.dev`:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `docs/build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

You can check the newly built site with the following command:

```bash
yarn run serve
```

:::note
By default, this will also load your site at <http://localhost:3000/>.

You can specify a different port with `yarn start --port <port-number>`.
:::

## Adding a new dependency

Use the `add` sub command to add new dependencies to the project:

```bash
yarn add package-name
```

## Linting

Before opening a PR, you can run the docs linter and formatter to ensure code consistency.

1. Navigate to the `docs` directory.

2. Run the following commands:

```bash
yarn run lint
yarn run format
```
