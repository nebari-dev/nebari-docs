You can help make the docs awesome. We strive to create inclusive, comprehensive, and enjoyable documentation for our users
and everyone can help! Found a typo or an incorrect code example? Put up a PR! Found a better way to explain a concept?
Put up a PR! Contributions to our documentation are valuable and greatly appreciated. Visit the [Documentation contributions section](doc-contributions.md)

### Contribute code

The Nebari repo consists of many interconnected pieces, making it difficult to start. Read the
[Code contributions guide](code-contributions.md) to learn how to set up the repository locally, how to contribute to
the project, and how to create a Pull Request.

### Help triage issues

Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the given reproduction, verifying the issue's validity,
and investigating the root cause of the problem. You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although
it would undoubtedly be much appreciated), but sharing your investigation results can save us a ton of time.
