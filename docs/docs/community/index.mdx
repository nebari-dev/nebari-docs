Thanks for being part of the Nebari community!

Open source doesn't always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming.
The Nebari team believes that everyone belongs in open source, and Nebari is dedicated to making you feel welcome.

All questions and contributions are welcome. Contributions can include issues, contributing code, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts,
helping out people, organizing community events, working on accessibility and design items, and more.
Continue reading to learn what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.
By contributing to open source projects, you can connect with people, learn new skills, become a subject-matter expert,
and apply all learnings to your projects. We look forward to hearing from you!

### Help triage issues

[Triaging an issue][nebari-issues] means gathering missing information, running the given reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the root cause of the problem.
You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although it would undoubtedly be much appreciated), but sharing your investigation results can save us a ton of time.
