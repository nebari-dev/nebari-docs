Nebari plugins (sometimes referred to as extensions) allow developers to add new features relatively easily without the need to modify the core Nebari code base. At the moment, there are two types of plugins `stages` and `subcommands`. Stage plugins allow users to deploy new features alongside the existing the Nebari features whereas subcommand plugins allow users to extend or modify the existing Nebari CLI.

You can learn to use and create Nebari extensions in the [extension mechanism documentation](/docs/how-tos/nebari-extension-system).
