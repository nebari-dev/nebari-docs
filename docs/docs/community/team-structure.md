The Nebari project has a team-based governance structure, implemented transparently using [GitHub's team features](https://github.com/orgs/nebari-dev/teams).
This page documents the different teams (and members), the privileges and responsibilities of each team, and how you can join the teams.

## General teams

These are the primary Nebari teams that form a part of the governance structure.

### Triage

Members of this team are responsible for triaging new and existing issues & pull requests (PRs) [following these guidelines](./maintainers/triage-guidelines), and [improving the issues/PRs](./file-issues#working-on-issues-to-improve-them) when needed. To do this, they have the ability to add relevant labels to issues/PRs, edit issue/PR titles and descriptions to improve them, and transfer issues to other Nebari repositories.

To join this team, you must have engaged with (created or commented on) at least one issue or PR in any repository in the Nebari GitHub organization, or a GitHub discussion topic. If you meet these requirements and would like to join the team, let us know by opening a GitHub discussions topic in the ["Community" category](https://github.com/orgs/nebari-dev/discussions/categories/community). Any Nebari team member (general or special interest team) can nominate people to join the Triage team, again by opening a GitHub discussions topic in the "Community" category. Any member of the "Core" team can approve and add people to the Triage team.

### Contributors

This team recognizes people who make valuable contributions to the Nebari project, by contributing to and maintaining the documentation or design assets, triaging issues/PRs, managing the community forums, fund raising, advocating for the project, and more.

Members of this team are usually also part of a special interest team, and have certain commit rights granted by the special interest team. The "Contributors" team does not have any extra privileges associated with it.

Any Nebari team member can nominate people (including themselves) to join this team by opening a GitHub discussions topic in the ["Community" category](https://github.com/orgs/nebari-dev/discussions/categories/community). Any member of the "Core" team can approve and add people to the Contributors team.
