# JHub App Launcher with Nebari

[JHub App Launcher](https://jhub-apps.nebari.dev/) is a generalized server launcher
for deploying web applications via JupyterHub. The App Launcher serves as the "home"
page for Nebari - providing access to various Nebari services (e.g. JupyterLab, VS Code, 
conda-store) and access to deploy custom web apps.

- Panel

- Voila
- Gradio
- JupyterLab
- Any generic Python command

## Usage

Documentation on how to create apps is included in the 
[JHub Apps documentation](https://jhub-apps.nebari.dev/docs/category/create-apps).
Deployed apps on Nebari will utilize environments from conda-store. All apps 
will need to include `jhsingle-native-proxy >= 0.8.2` in their environment along with 
other framework-specific dependencies. For example, deploying a `panel` app will 
require `panel` itself and additional tools for deploying `panel` apps such as 
`bokeh-root-cmd >= 0.1.2`. See the documentation for specific requirements on 
each framework.
