## Debug the Kubernetes Cluster

If you need more information about your Kubernetes cluster, [`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI that is extremely useful for debugging. It simplifies navigating, observing, and managing your applications in Kubernetes. `k9s` continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed resources. It's a fast way to review and resolve day-to-day issues in Kubernetes, a huge improvement to the general workflow, and a best-to-have tool for debugging your Kubernetes cluster sessions.

[Installation instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) are available.

By default, `k9s` starts with the standard directory that's set as the context (in this case Minikube). To view all the current process press 0:

> **NOTE**: In some circumstances, you will be confronted with the need to inspect any services launched by your cluster at your `localhost`. For instance, if your cluster has problem with the network traffic tunnel configuration, it may limit or block the userâ€™s access to destination resources over the connection.

`k9s` port-forward option <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> allows you to access and interact with internal Kubernetes cluster processes from your localhost you can then use this method to investigate issues and adjust your services locally without the need to expose them beforehand.
