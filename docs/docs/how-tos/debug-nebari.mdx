The beauty of Nebari is that most Dev Ops management is already handled for you.
However, there will likely come a time that you will need to debug your Nebari
instance. This debug guide contains some tips and tricks to help you in your
debug endeavors.

## Debugging the Kubernetes Cluster using k9s

If you need more information about your Kubernetes cluster,
[`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI that is extremely useful
for debugging. It simplifies navigating, observing, and managing your
applications in Kubernetes. `k9s` continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters
for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed
resources. It's a fast way to review and resolve day-to-day issues in
Kubernetes, a huge improvement to the general workflow, and a best-to-have
tool for debugging your Kubernetes cluster sessions.

### Setting up k9s for Nebari

First, follow the [installation instructions](https://k9scli.io/) on the k9s
documentation.

During the `nebari deploy` proccesss, the configuration file `kubeconfig`
will have been autogenerated. If you need to regenerate the configuration, you
can refer to the following section. If you already have this set up, you can
skip to the [Getting started with k9s](#getting-started-with-k9s) below.

#### Generating the `kubeconfig`

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gcp" label="Google GCP" default>

For [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) (also known as Google Cloud
Platform or GCP), you'll need to have
[gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed. The command to
update your `kubeconfig` for GCP is:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <project-name>-<namespace> --region <region>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="do" label="Digital Ocean">

For [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/),
you'll need to have the
[doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) tool
(the Digital Ocean CLI) installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for DO is:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aws" label="Amazon AWS">

For [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),
you'll need to have the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for AWS is:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

For [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/),
you'll need to have the
[azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for Azure is:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <project-name>-<namespace> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Getting started with k9s

Launch `k9s` from a terminal on your local machine. It will look for the
configuration in the `kubeconfig` to dial the connection with the cluster.

To view all the current processes press 0:

Using `k9s` you can inspect any services launched by your cluster. For
example, if your cluster has problems with the network traffic tunnel
configuration, it may limit or block a user's access to destination resources
such as files or workers, using `k9s` you can inspect the network
configuration as well as the connection logs.

From within k9s, the port-forward keystroke, <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>,
allows you to access and interact with your Kubernetes cluster from your
local machine. You can then use this method to investigate issues and adjust
your services locally without the need to expose them beforehand.

Let's suppose you are deploying a new service to Nebari, and would like to
quickly debug any connection related problems around it, for example a 404
Error. With port-forwarding you can attest if the origin of the problem
lies within the service itself or with the networking aspects of the
connection, for example an Ingress route misconfiguration. This allows you to
check the service status without any extra modifications to its
structure.
