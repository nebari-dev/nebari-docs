description: Debug your Nebari deployment

The beauty of Nebari is that most Dev Ops management is already handled for you.
However, there will likely come a time that you will need to debug your Nebari
instance. This debug guide contains some tips and tricks to help you in your
debug endeavors.

## Debugging the Kubernetes Cluster using k9s

If you need more information about your Kubernetes cluster,
[`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI that is extremely useful
for debugging. It simplifies navigating, observing, and managing your
applications in Kubernetes. `k9s` continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters
for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed
resources. It's a fast way to review and resolve day-to-day issues in
Kubernetes, a huge improvement to the general workflow, and a best-to-have
tool for debugging your Kubernetes cluster sessions.

### Setting up k9s for Nebari

First, follow the [installation instructions](https://k9scli.io/) on the k9s
documentation to install k9s on your local machine.

:::note
If you deployed manually from your local machine, the configuration file
`kubeconfig` will have been autogenerated during the `nebari deploy` process.
You can skip to the [Getting started with k9s](#getting-started-with-k9s) below.

#### Generating the `kubeconfig`

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gcp" label="Google GCP" default>

For [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) (also known as Google Cloud
Platform or GCP), you'll need to have
[gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.

Next, install the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` component (this step will become
outdated once [GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) version 1.26 is released](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke)).

```bash
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

To enable this plugin, you'll need to update `gcloud` by:

1. Set `export USE_GKE_GCLOUD_AUTH_PLUGIN=True` in `~/.bashrc` (or in
   Environment variables for Windows).

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   For Windows environments, start a new terminal.

3. Update gcloud to the latest version.

   ```bash
   gcloud components update
   ```

Now you'll need to authenticate to GCP using:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

Finally, you can generate the `kubeconfig` which will be used by k9s:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <project-name>-<namespace> --region <region>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="do" label="Digital Ocean">

For [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/),
you'll need to have the
[doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) tool
(the Digital Ocean CLI) installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for DO is:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aws" label="Amazon AWS">

For [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),
you'll need to have the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for AWS is:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

For [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/),
you'll need to have the
[azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for Azure is:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <project-name>-<namespace> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Getting started with k9s

Launch `k9s` from a terminal on your local machine. It will look for the
configuration in the `kubeconfig` to dial the connection with the cluster.

```bash
$ k9s
```

**To view all the current processes**

Use the shortcut <kbd>0</kbd> (this may be the default).

![Image of the k9s terminal UI](/img/how-tos/k9s_UI.png)

Using `k9s` you can inspect any services launched by your cluster. For
example, if your cluster has problems with the network traffic tunnel
configuration, it may limit or block a user's access to destination resources
such as files or workers, using `k9s` you can inspect the network
configuration as well as the connection logs.

**To debug processes running on pod**

Use the arrow keys to navigate to a pod for your Nebari instance. Then,
you can investigate the pod by clicking <kbd>Enter</kbd> or by typing the
hotkey <kbd>l</kbd>.

### Advanced k9s usage

From within k9s, the port-forward keystroke, <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>,
allows you to access and interact with your Kubernetes cluster from your
local machine. You can then use this method to investigate issues and adjust
your services locally without the need to expose them beforehand.

Let's suppose you are deploying a new service to Nebari, and would like to
quickly debug any connection related problems around it, for example a `404 Error`. With port-forwarding you can attest if the origin of the problem
lies within the service itself or with the networking aspects of the
connection, for example an Ingress route misconfiguration. This allows you to
check the service status without any extra modifications to its
structure.

### Troubleshooting

If your k9s instance fails to connect to your cluster, ensure that you have the
authentication set up properly. k9s may give you a warning similar to:
"Dial K9s Toast [X/5]".

If your k9s instance closes for unknown reasons, you can check the k9s logs.
You can specify where your log file is located by:

```bash
k9s --logFile string
```

or you can inspect the default temporary directory by looking up the `logFile`
attribute description in `k9s --help`.
