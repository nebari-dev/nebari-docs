The beauty of Nebari is that most Dev Ops management is already handled for you.
However, there will likely come a time that you will need to debug your Nebari
instance. This debug guide contains some tips and tricks to help you in your
debug endeavors.

## Generating the `kubeconfig`

:::note
A file that is used to configure access to clusters is called a _kubeconfig_ file.
This is a generic way of referring to configuration files in the Kubernetes context.
Generally, it does not mean that there will be a file named kubeconfig present in your machine.
:::

Generating the `kubeconfig` is an essential step to get started with `kubectl`, `k9s` or
any other kubernetes management tool. The kubeconfig file contains all the necessary
information for kubectl to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster, including the API
server address, authentication credentials, and cluster details. In this section, we
will cover the process of generating a kubeconfig file and updating it to allow
kubectl to access your Nebari Kubernetes cluster.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gcp" label="Google GCP" default>

For [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) (also known as Google Cloud
Platform or GCP), you'll need to have
[gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.

Next, install the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` component (this step will become
outdated once [GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) version 1.26 is released](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke)).

```bash
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

To enable this plugin, you'll need to update `gcloud` by:

1. Set `export USE_GKE_GCLOUD_AUTH_PLUGIN=True` in `~/.bashrc` (or in
   Environment variables for Windows).

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   For Windows environments, start a new terminal.

3. Update gcloud to the latest version.

   ```bash
   gcloud components update
   ```

Now you'll need to authenticate to GCP using:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

Finally, you can generate the `kubeconfig` which will be used by k9s:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <project-name>-<namespace> --region <region>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="do" label="Digital Ocean">

For [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/),
you'll need to have the
[doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) tool
(the Digital Ocean CLI) installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for DO is:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aws" label="Amazon AWS">

For [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),
you'll need to have the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for AWS is:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

For [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/),
you'll need to have the
[azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
installed. The command to update your `kubeconfig` for Azure is:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <project-name>-<namespace> --name <project-name>-<namespace>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="local" label="Local (Testing)">

If you deployed manually from your local machine, the configuration file
`kubeconfig` will have been autogenerated during the `nebari deploy` process.

## Getting started with `kubectl`

kubectl is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with Kubernetes clusters,
view and modify cluster resources, and debug issues with your deployments. In this
guide, we will cover how to install kubectl and use it to troubleshoot issues with
your Nebari deployments.

### Installing kubectl

Before proceeding, we need to make sure that kubectl is installed on your local machine.
Here are some steps to validate its presence or related documentation on how to install it:

1. Check if `kubectl` is already installed on your machine by running the following
   command:

```bash
kubectl version --client
```

2. If kubectl is not installed, you can download and install it following the instructions
   in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).
   The installation steps may vary depending on your operating system, so be sure to follow the
   instructions that apply to your system.

### Using kubectl to debug Kubernetes deployments

Once you have installed kubectl, you can use it to debug issues within your Nebari Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl provides a variety of commands and options to help you diagnose and fix issues with your deployment.
In this section, we will cover some useful `kubectl` commands to get you started.

<details><summary>Viewing all pods in a namespace</summary>

To view all the pods in a namespace, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

This command lists all the pods in the specified namespace. You can use the namespace flag `(-n)`
to specify the namespace you want to view.

</details>

<details><summary>Viewing all pods in all namespaces</summary>

To view the logs for a specific pod, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Replace `pod-name` with the name of the pod you want to view logs for, and `namespace` with
the namespace the pod is deployed in. This command displays the logs for the specified pod.

:::note
Usually Nebari is deployed into the `dev` namespace, but you can double check the assigned
value by inspecting your `nebari-config.yaml` under the `namespace` key. For more information
refer to [general configuration settings](docs/explanations/advanced-configuration#general-configuration-settings).
:::

</details>

<details><summary>Viewing logs for a specific pod</summary>

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/bash
```

Replace `pod-name` with the name of the pod you want to execute the command in, and `namespace`
with the namespace the pod is deployed in. This command opens a shell inside the specified pod,
allowing you to execute commands as if you were logged into the pod.

</details>

### Troubleshooting

:::tip
By default, `kubectl` looks for a file named config in the `$HOME/.kube` directory.
You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or
by setting the `--kubeconfig` flag. Generally, your cloud provider CLI will automatically
handle the kubeconfig directory reference for you.

For step-by-step instructions on creating and specifying kubeconfig files, see
[Configure Access to Multiple Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters).
:::

If you encounter issues connecting to your Nebari cluster using kubectl, ensure that your
kubeconfig file is set up correctly. You can refer to the previous section on [how to update your
kubeconfig](#generating-the-kubeconfig) using the cloud provider CLI.

If you are still experiencing issues, check the logs for any error messages that may provide
clues to the issue. You can also consider reaching out to the Nebari support team for assistance
by creating an issue on the Nebari issues page.

## Debugging the Kubernetes Cluster using k9s

If you need more information about your Kubernetes cluster,
[`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI that is extremely useful
for debugging. It simplifies navigating, observing, and managing your
applications in Kubernetes. `k9s` continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters
for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed
resources. It's a fast way to review and resolve day-to-day issues in
Kubernetes, a huge improvement to the general workflow, and a best-to-have
tool for debugging your Kubernetes cluster sessions.

### Setting up k9s for Nebari

First, follow the [installation instructions](https://k9scli.io/) on the k9s
documentation to install k9s on your local machine.

### Getting started with k9s

Launch `k9s` from a terminal on your local machine. It will look for the
configuration in the `kubeconfig` to dial the connection with the cluster.

```bash
$ k9s
```

**To view all the current processes**

Use the shortcut <kbd>0</kbd> (this may be the default).

![Image of the k9s terminal UI](/img/how-tos/k9s_UI.png)

Using `k9s` you can inspect any services launched by your cluster. For
example, if your cluster has problems with the network traffic tunnel
configuration, it may limit or block a user's access to destination resources
such as files or workers, using `k9s` you can inspect the network
configuration as well as the connection logs.

**To debug processes running on pod**

Use the arrow keys to navigate to a pod for your Nebari instance. Then,
you can investigate the pod by clicking <kbd>Enter</kbd> or by typing the
hotkey <kbd>l</kbd>.

### Advanced k9s usage

From within k9s, the port-forward keystroke, <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>,
allows you to access and interact with your Kubernetes cluster from your
local machine. You can then use this method to investigate issues and adjust
your services locally without the need to expose them beforehand.

Let's suppose you are deploying a new service to Nebari, and would like to
quickly debug any connection related problems around it, for example a `404 Error`. With port-forwarding you can attest if the origin of the problem
lies within the service itself or with the networking aspects of the
connection, for example an Ingress route misconfiguration. This allows you to
check the service status without any extra modifications to its
structure.

### Troubleshooting

If your k9s instance fails to connect to your cluster, ensure that you have the
authentication set up properly. k9s may give you a warning similar to:
"Dial K9s Toast [X/5]".

If your k9s instance closes for unknown reasons, you can check the k9s logs.
You can specify where your log file is located by:

```bash
k9s --logFile string
```

or you can inspect the default temporary directory by looking up the `logFile`
attribute description in `k9s --help`.
