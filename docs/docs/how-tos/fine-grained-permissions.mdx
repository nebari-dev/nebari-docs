title: Creating and Managing Groups, Roles, and Directories
description: How to configure Keycloak's permissions, groups and roles, and manage group directories in JupyterHub.
---

Groups are a fundamental and vital part of the Nebari ecosystem. They are used to manage access to a wide range of
services within Nebari, including JupyterHub instances, Keycloak realms, Conda environments, and computing resources. By
grouping users based on roles, projects, or departments, Nebari simplifies the management of permissions and resource
sharing.

Beyond managing access, groups play a crucial role in organizing and sharing data across the JupyterHub ecosystem. Each
group can have its own shared directory within JupyterHub, allowing users within the same group to collaborate
seamlessly by sharing files and resources. This facilitates team collaboration and ensures that data is organized and
accessible to those who need it.

In this document, we will cover:

- How to create and manage groups and subgroups in Keycloak
- How to assign roles and permissions to groups
- How groups and roles interact within Nebari's services, such as JupyterHub and Conda-Store
- How to manage group directories in JupyterHub

## Managing Groups in Keycloak

Keycloak is the identity and access management service used in Nebari. It allows you to create and manage users, groups,
roles, and permissions. Groups in Keycloak are collections of users, and they can be assigned specific roles that grant
permissions to access various services within Nebari.

For detailed information on managing groups in Keycloak, refer to the
[Keycloak documentation on Group Management](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_group_management).

Below we outline the steps specific to Nebari.

### Creating a New Group

To create a new group in Keycloak:

1. **Log in to Keycloak** as an administrator (usually the `root` user).
2. **Navigate to Groups**: Click on **Groups** in the left-hand menu.
3. **Create the Group**: Click the **New** button, enter an appropriate name for your new group (e.g.,
   `conda-store-manager`), and save.

If you wish to organize your groups hierarchically, you can create subgroups by selecting a parent group and adding a
subgroup.

# Fine Grained Permissions via Keycloak

Nebari uses Keycloak to centrally manage roles, permissions, and scopes for various services like `jupyterhub` and
`conda-store`. By default, Nebari provides a set of predefined clients and default roles that cover common needs—such as
basic view/read permissions or full admin control, a full list of which can be found in the [] section.

However, certain environments require more specialized or granular access controls. In these cases, administrators (or
any user with appropriate privileges) can create custom roles and scopes directly in Keycloak. This allows you to tailor
the permission model to fit your precise security and governance requirements—all while still benefiting from the
ready-to-use defaults Nebari provides.
title: Fine-Grained Permissions via Keycloak
description: Learn how to manage roles, groups, and scopes in Keycloak to grant fine-grained permissions in Nebari.
---
Nebari uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to centrally manage roles,
permissions, and scopes for its core services like `jupyterhub` and `conda-store`. By
default, Nebari provides:

- **Predefined roles** (e.g., `conda_store_admin`, `jupyterhub_developer`)
- **Default groups** (`admin`, `developer`, `analyst`, `superadmin`)
- **Clients** corresponding to key Nebari services

These defaults cover most common access requirements. However, when more specific or
granular access control is needed, administrators can create custom roles and scopes in
Keycloak, see [Creating Custom Roles with Scopes](#creating-custom-roles-with-scopes).

## Default Clients and Groups in Nebari

Overview
- *Roles*: Define a set of permissions (or scopes) for a particular client (service).
- *Groups*: Aggregate users who share similar permissions.
- *Scopes*: The individual permissions (e.g., “read:users:name” for reading user names) that can be attached to a role.

By creating custom roles with specific scopes, and assigning them to groups or users, you can fine-tune exactly who can
do what in your Nebari environment. More details on how to create roles and scopes can be found in the
[Creating a Role](#creating-a-role) section.

## Default Clients and permissions in Nebari

Nebari comes with several custom Keycloak clients in a fresh deployment. These map to key Nebari services and
integrations:

By default, Nebari comes with several custom clients included in a fresh deployment. These clients facilitate various
services and integrations within the Nebari ecosystem. The predefined clients are as follows:
A fresh Nebari deployment comes with several custom Keycloak clients (services) enabled.
You can manage these from **Clients** in the Keycloak admin console:

```yaml
clients:
  - jupyterhub
  - conda_store
  - grafana (if monitoring is enabled)
  - argo-server-sso (if argo is enabled)
  - forwardauth
```

To manage and configure these clients, you can navigate to the `Clients` tab within the Keycloak admin console, as
illustrated in the image below.

![Keycloak clients](/img/how-tos/fine_grainer_permissions_keycloak_clients.png)

This can be accessed at `<nebari-url>/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/nebari/clients`

Groups represent a collection of users that perform similar actions and therefore require similar permissions. By
default, Nebari is deployed with the following groups: `admin`, `developer`, and `analyst` (in roughly descending order
of permissions and scope).

:::info
Users in a particular group will also get access to that groups shared folder. So if `user A` belongs to the
`developer`, they will also have access to the `~/shared/developer` folder. This also applies to new groups that you
create.
:::

Roles on the other hand represent the type or category of user. This includes access and permissions that this category
of user will need to perform their regular job duties. The differences between `groups` and `roles` are subtle.
Particular roles (one or many), like `conda_store_admin`, are associated with a particular group, such as `admin` and
any user in this group will then assume the role of `conda_store_admin`.

:::info
These roles can be stacked. This means that if a user is in one group with role `conda_store_admin` and another group
with role `conda_store_viewer`, this user ultimately has the role `conda_store_admin`.
:::

## In-depth look at Roles and Groups

Below is a table illustrating each default group, the resources they can access, and the roles they inherit. The table
also includes a brief description of the permissions granted to each group.

import React from 'react';

export const GroupTable = ({ groups }) => {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Group</th>
          <th>Access to Nebari Resources</th>
          <th>Roles</th>
          <th>Permissions Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {groups.map((group) => (
          <tr key={group.groupName}>
            {/* 1. Resources */}
            <td>
              <ul>
                {group.resources.map((resource) => (
                  <li key={resource}>{resource}</li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </td>

            {/* 2. Roles */}
            <td>
              <ul>
                {group.roles.map((role) => (
                  <li key={role}>{role}</li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </td>

            {/* 3. Permissions Description */}
            <td>
              <ul>
                {group.permissions.map((perm, i) => (
                  <li key={i}>{perm}</li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};
Users are organized into default groups: `admin`, `developer`, `analyst`, and
`superadmin`. Each group has one or more default roles that define their access level
across Nebari services.

:::info Shared Folders
Membership in one of the default groups also grants access to the corresponding shared
folder (e.g., the `developer` group has access to `~/shared/developer`). Since,
`2024.9.1` Nebari now required a special role to access the shared folders
`Allow-group-directory-creation-role`.

## In-depth Look at Default Roles and Groups

Groups represent a collection of users that perform similar actions and therefore
require similar permissions. By default, Nebari is deployed with the following groups:
`admin`, `developer`, and `analyst` (in roughly descending order of permissions and
scope).

Roles on the other hand represent the type or category of user. This includes access and
permissions that this category of user will need to perform their regular job duties.
The differences between `groups` and `roles` are subtle. Particular roles (one or many),
like `conda_store_admin`, are associated with a particular group, such as `admin` and
any user in this group will then assume the role of `conda_store_admin`.

:::tip Technical Note
Roles in nebari can stack, meaning that if a user is in one group with role
`conda_store_admin` and another group with role `conda_store_viewer`, this user
ultimately has the role `conda_store_admin`. Also, in case of different level of access
orignating from different groups, precedence is given to the highest level of access.

The role `jupyterhub_admin` gives users elevated permissions to JupyterHub and should be applied judiciously. As
mentioned in the table above, a JupyterHub admin is able to impersonate other users and view the contents of their home
folder. For more details, read through the
[JupyterHub documentation](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-management.html#admin-users).

for more info.
:::

## Roles, Groups, and Scopes

As an example, we create a new group named `conda-store-manager`. This group will have administrator access to the
[Conda-Store service].
When managing user access in Nebari, it's helpful to understand how **roles**,
**groups**, and **scopes** work together:

- **Roles**: A named set of permissions, while also providing a way to categorize users
  by their access level or job function. Example: `conda_store_developer` or
  `jupyterhub_admin`.
- **Groups**: Collections of users who need similar permissions. For example, the
  `developer` group might contain multiple roles like `conda_store_developer` and
  `jupyterhub_developer`.
- **Scopes**: A Service's fine-grained permission entity within a role. For instance, a
  JupyterHub scope might be `read:users:name` (to read other users’ names), while a
  Conda-Store scope might be `admin!namespace=analyst` (to grant admin-level access in
  the `analyst` namespace).

Whenever you create or modify a role in Keycloak, it won’t affect anyone until it’s
assigned to a group or user. Below is the general process:

**Typical Workflow**:
1. **Create or edit** a role (and define its scopes) under the relevant **Client**
   (e.g., `jupyterhub`, `conda_store`) in Keycloak.
2. **Assign** this role to a **group** (or directly to an individual user).
3. **Add users** to that group if you haven’t already.

:::note
Users must log out and log back in for newly assigned roles to take effect.
:::

### Granting Permissions to a User

Let’s say you have someone who only needs *administrator-level privileges for
Conda-Store*, while leaving other services at their default access.

As an example, we create a new group named `conda-store-manager`. This group will have
administrator access to the `Conda-Store` service.

1. Click **New** in the upper-right hand corner under **Groups**.

![Keycloak groups tab screenshot - user groups view](/img/how-tos/keycloak_groups.png)

- Then, give the new group an appropriate name.

![Keycloak add group form - name field set to conda-store-manager](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group1.png)

2. Under **Role Mapping**, add the appropriate **Client Roles** as needed; there should be no need to update the **Realm
   Roles**.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused with expanded client roles dropdown](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group2.png)

In this example, the new group only has one mapped role, `conda_store_admin`; however, it's possible to attach multiple
**Client Roles** to a single group.
2. Under **Role Mapping**, add the appropriate **Client Roles** as needed; there should
   be no need to update the **Realm Roles**.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused with expanded client roles dropdown](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group2.png)

In this example, the new group only has one mapped role, `conda_store_admin`; however,
it's possible to attach multiple **Client Roles** to a single group.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused ](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group3.png)

Once complete, return to the **Users** section in the dashboard and add the relevant
users to this newly created group.

:::note
To create new groups or modify (or delete) existing groups, log in as `root` and click
**Groups** on the left-hand side.
:::

### Creating Custom Roles with Scopes

Beyond Nebari’s default roles, you can also create your own with highly specific
permissions. The process for creating a role is similar, irrespective of the service.

:::warning
Nebari currently only supports custom roles for the `jupyterhub` and `conda_store`.
Future releases may extend this to other services.
:::

#### Components and Syntax

In Nebari, **scopes** are closely tied to the service (client) you’re working
with— In Keycloak's roles we identify them as “components.”

- **Components**:
  Specifies the service that a role’s scopes apply to (e.g., `jupyterhub` or `conda-store`).
- **Scopes**:
  The actual permission strings recognized by that service.

<div style={{'border-radius': '15px', 'border': '2px solid var(--ifm-color-background-3)', 'padding': '20px', 'margin-bottom': '20px'}}>

#### JupyterHub Scopes

JupyterHub scopes syntax in Nebari follow [JupyterHub’s built-in RBAC
syntax](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html). For example:
```
shares!user,read:users:name,read:groups:name
```
- `shares!user`: Allows sharing servers with other users.
- `read:users:name`: Grants read access to other users’ names.
- `read:groups:name`: Grants read access to other groups’ names.

This combination allows a user to share their server with others (via `shares!user`) and
also read other users’ and groups’ names.

For a complete list of JupyterHub scopes, see the
[https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#available-scopes](JupyterHub
documentation).

Nebari extend these scoped including a new *share* scope that is reserved for
`Jhub-apps` usage, allowing, as seen above for sharing servers with other users,
including more specifcaly jhub-apps applications (apps).

---

#### Conda-Store Scopes

Conda-Store scopes are defined at the namespace level. For example:
```
admin!namespace=analyst,developer!namespace=nebari-git
```
- `admin!namespace=analyst`: Grants an **admin** role in the `analyst` namespace.
- `developer!namespace=nebari-git`: Grants a **developer** role in the `nebari-git` namespace.

This grants an **admin** role in the `analyst` namespace, plus a **developer** role in
the `nebari-git` namespace. When assigned to a user or group, these permissions apply
only to those specified namespaces in Conda-Store.

Conda-store scopes follow a much simpler syntax than JupyterHub scopes, as they are only
defined at the namespace level:
```
<access_level>!namespace=<namespace_name>
```
whereas the `access_level` there entices the available conda-store' roles as per its own
documentation
[Conda-Store
role-mappings](https://conda.store/conda-store/explanations/conda-store-concepts#role-mappings).

</div>

### Creating a Role

The process for creating a role is similar, irrespective of the service. To create a role for a service
In the following example, we create a new role for the `JupyterHub` client granting the
same level of permission outlined in the section above [JupyterHub Scopes](#jupyterhub-scopes).

1. Select the appropriate client and click on "Add Role".
![Keycloak client add jupyterhub role](/img/how-tos/keycloak_jupyterhub_client.png)

2. On the "Add Role" form, write a meaningful name and description for the role. Be sure to include what this role
   intends to accomplish. Click "Save".

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_jupyterhub_add_role.png)

3. Now the role has been created, but it does nothing. Let's add some permissions to it by clicking on the "Attributes"
   tab and adding scopes. The following sections will explain the `components` and `scopes` in more detail.

   ![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_add_role_attributes.png)

### Adding Role to Group(s) / User(s)

Creating a role in Keycloak has no effect on any user or group's permissions. To grant a set of permissions to a user or
group, we need to _attach_ the role to the user or group. To add a role to a user:

1. Select users on the left sidebar and enter the username in the Lookup searchbar.

   ![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_select_user.png)

2. Select that user and click on the "Role Mappings" tab.

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_tab.png)

3. Select the Client associated with the Role being added.

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_roles.png)

4. Select the role in the "Available Roles" and click on "Add Selected >>".

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_add_role.png)

To attach a role to a group, follow the above steps by clicking on the groups tab and selecting a group instead of
selecting the user in the first step.

In the above section, we learned how to create a role with some attributes and attach it to a user or a group. Now we
will learn how to create scopes to grant a particular set of permissions to the user.

:::note
After the roles are assigned to a user or group in Keycloak, the user **must** logout and login back in to the service
for the roles to take in effect. For example let's say we add a set of roles for `conda-store` to the user named "John
Doe", now for the user "John Doe" to be able to avail newly granted/revoked roles, they need to login to conda-store
again (similarly for `jupyterhub` as well), after the roles are granted/revoked.
:::

### Adding Users to a Group

To add users to a group:

1. **Navigate to Users**: Click on **Users** in the left-hand menu.
2. **Select a User**: Choose the user you want to add to a group.
3. **Assign to Group**:
   - Click on the **Groups** tab within the user's details.
   - Click the **Join** button.
   - Select the group (and subgroup, if applicable) you wish to add the user to.
   - Click **Join** to add the user to the group.

Repeat this process for all users who should be part of the group.

### Managing Subgroups

Subgroups allow you to create a hierarchical structure of groups, representing organizational units, projects, or teams.
Subgroups inherit roles and attributes from their parent groups unless explicitly overridden.

To manage subgroups:

- **Creating Subgroups**: Select the parent group, navigate to the **Sub Groups** tab, and create a new subgroup.
- **Assigning Roles to Subgroups**: Roles are not automatically inherited; assign roles to subgroups as needed.
- **Use Cases**: Organize groups hierarchically to reflect organizational structures.

For more information, see the
[Keycloak documentation on Group Hierarchies](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#group-hierarchies).

## Managing Group Directories in JupyterHub

:::note Important
As of version `2024.9.1`, JupyterHub creates and mounts directories only for groups with the
`allow-group-directory-creation-role`. By default, this includes the `admin`, `analyst`, and `developer` groups.
Previously, directories were automatically created for all Keycloak groups. This change gives administrators more
control over shared directories and overall access management without cluttering the file system.
:::

### Understanding Group Directories

A group directory in JupyterHub is a shared folder accessible to all members of a specific group. It provides a shared
space within the file system for collaboration.

An example directory structure:

```yaml

### Assigning the `allow-group-directory-creation-role` to a Group

To enable directory creation and mounting for a group in JupyterHub, assign the `allow-group-directory-creation-role` to
the group in Keycloak.

#### Steps to Assign the Role:

1. **Navigate to the Group**: Log in to Keycloak as an administrator and select the group.
2. **Go to Role Mappings**: Click on the **Role Mappings** tab.
3. **Assign the Role**:
   - Under **Client Roles**, select the `jupyterhub` client.
   - Select `allow-group-directory-creation-role` and click **Add selected**.

Users in this group will now have access to the group's shared directory in JupyterHub.

### Rolling Back the Change

To remove the group's directory access:

1. **Navigate to the Group's Role Mappings**: Select the group and go to the **Role Mappings** tab.
2. **Remove the Role**:
   - Under **Assigned Roles**, select `allow-group-directory-creation-role`.
   - Click **Remove selected**.

**Data Preservation:** No data is deleted when you remove the role; the directory is simply unmounted from users'
JupyterLab sessions.

### Managing Subgroup Directories

Subgroups can have their own directories in JupyterHub if assigned the `allow-group-directory-creation-role`. Assign the
role to subgroups as needed to control access and collaboration.

## In-Depth Look at Roles and Groups

Understanding how roles and groups work together is essential for effectively managing access and permissions within
Nebari.

### Groups

Groups represent collections of users who perform similar functions or belong to the same organizational unit. They
simplify user management by allowing you to assign roles and permissions at the group level rather than individually to
each user.

By default, Nebari is deployed with the following groups:

- **admin**: Users with administrative privileges who can manage the system, configurations, and users.
- **developer**: Users who need access to development tools and environments.
- **analyst**: Users who primarily analyze data and may have restricted access compared to developers.

Groups can be organized hierarchically using subgroups, allowing for more granular control and reflecting organizational
structures.

:::info
**Shared Directories:** Users in a particular group will have access to that group's shared directory in JupyterHub if
the group has the `allow-group-directory-creation-role` assigned.
:::

### Roles

Roles define a set of permissions that grant access to specific resources or capabilities within Nebari's services. They
are assigned to groups or users and determine what actions they can perform.

Roles can be of two types:

- **Realm Roles**: Apply globally across all clients (applications) in Keycloak.
- **Client Roles**: Specific to a client (application), such as `jupyterhub`, `conda-store`, or `grafana`.

Examples of roles include:

- `admin`: Grants administrative privileges within a client.
- `developer`: Grants development-related permissions.
- `conda_store_admin`: Allows managing Conda environments in Conda-Store.

### Interaction Between Roles and Groups

Roles are assigned to groups, and users inherit those roles through their group memberships. This means that:

- **Users in a Group Get the Group's Roles**: If a group has certain roles assigned, all users in that group will
  inherit those roles.
- **Multiple Roles Can Be Assigned**: A group can have multiple roles from different clients, providing access to
  various services.
- **Roles Are Not Inherited by Subgroups**: Roles need to be explicitly assigned to subgroups if you want them to have
  specific permissions.

### Role Hierarchies and Stacking

Roles can be designed to reflect hierarchical permissions. For example, an `admin` role may encompass all the
permissions of a `developer` role.

:::info
**Role Stacking:** If a user is a member of multiple groups with different roles, they effectively have the combined
permissions of all assigned roles. For instance, if a user is in a group with the `conda_store_admin` role and another
group with the `conda_store_viewer` role, the user will have administrative privileges in Conda-Store due to the higher
permission level of `conda_store_admin`.
:::

### Assigning Roles to Groups

When creating or editing a group in Keycloak:

1. **Select the Group**: Navigate to the group you wish to assign roles to.
2. **Go to Role Mappings**: Click on the **Role Mappings** tab.
3. **Assign Roles**:
   - Under **Client Roles**, select the client application.
   - Select the roles you wish to assign and click **Add selected**.

## Access Levels and Permissions

Roles on the other hand represent the type or category of user. This includes access and permissions that this category
of user will need to perform their regular job duties. The differences between `groups` and `roles` are subtle.
Particular roles (one or many), like `conda_store_admin`, are associated with a particular group, such as `admin` and
any user in this group will then assume the role of `conda_store_admin`.

:::info
These roles can be stacked. This means that if a user is in one group with role `conda_store_admin` and another group
with role `conda_store_viewer`, this user ultimately has the role `conda_store_admin`.
:::

Below is a summary of default groups, their access to Nebari resources, assigned roles, and permissions descriptions.

:::info
Check
[Conda-store authorization model](https://conda-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#authorization-model)
for more details on conda-store authorization.
:::

:::caution
The role `jupyterhub_admin` gives users elevated permissions to JupyterHub and should be applied judiciously. As
mentioned in the table above, a JupyterHub admin is able to impersonate other users and view the contents of their home
folder. For more details, read through the
[JupyterHub documentation](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-management.html#admin-users).
:::

To create new groups or modify (or delete) existing groups, log in as `root` and click **Groups** on the left-hand side.

As an example, we create a new group named `conda-store-manager`. This group will have administrator access to the
[Conda-Store service].

1. Click **New** in the upper-right hand corner under **Groups**.

![Keycloak groups tab screenshot - user groups view](/img/how-tos/keycloak_groups.png)

- Then, give the new group an appropriate name.

![Keycloak add group form - name field set to conda-store-manager](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group1.png)

2. Under **Role Mapping**, add the appropriate **Client Roles** as needed; there should be no need to update the **Realm
   Roles**.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused with expanded client roles dropdown](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group2.png)

In this example, the new group only has one mapped role, `conda_store_admin`; however, it's possible to attach multiple
**Client Roles** to a single group.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused ](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group3.png)

Once complete, return to the **Users** section in the dashboard and add the relevant users to this newly created group.
## Components and Scopes

When specifying fine-grained permissions in Keycloak, we use the `components` and `scopes` attributes. These attributes
are used to define the permissions that a role grants to a user or group. This model follows the RBAC (Role-Based Access
Control) model and is based upong the same structure utilized by
[Jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rbac/index.html).

### Components Attribute

We have seen in the above example the `component` attribute while creating a role. The value of this parameter depends
on the type of component in the service, we're creating a role for, currently we only have two components:

- `jupyterhub`: to create `jupyterhub` native roles in the `jupyterhub` client.
- `conda-store`: to create `conda-store` roles in the `conda_store` client

### JupyterHub Scopes

The syntax for the `scopes` attribute for a `jupyterhub` role in Keycloak in Nebari follows the native RBAC scopes
syntax for JupyterHub itself. The documentation can be found
[here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#scope-conventions).

As an example, scopes for allowing users to share apps in Nebari's `jhub-apps` launcher may look like this:

> `shares!user,read:users:name,read:groups:name`

The `scopes` defined above consists of three scopes:

- `shares!user`: grants permissions to share user's server
- `read:users:name`: grants permissions to read other user's names
- `read:groups:name`: grants permissions to read other groups's names

To be able to share a server to a group or a user you need to be able to read other user's or group's names and must
have permissions to be able to share your server, this is what this set of permissions implement.

### Conda Store Scopes

The scopes for roles for the `conda-store` Client are applied to the `namespace` level of `conda-store`.

Below is example of granting a user specialized permissions to `conda-store`:

> `admin!namespace=analyst,developer!namespace=nebari-git`

The `scopes` defined above consists of two scopes:

- `admin!namespace=analyst`: grants `admin` access to namespace `analyst`
- `developer!namespace=nebari-git`: grants `developer` access to namespace `nebari-git`

When attached to a user or a group, the above-mentioned permissions will be granted to the user/group.
1. On the "Add Role" form, write a meaningful name and description for the role. Be sure
   to include what this role intends to accomplish. Click "Save".

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_jupyterhub_add_role.png)

3. Now the role has been created, but it does nothing. Let's add some permissions to it
   by clicking on the "Attributes" tab and adding scopes. The following sections will
   explain the `components` and `scopes` in more detail.

   ![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_add_role_attributes.png)

To make these new permissions effective, assign the custom role to a user or group (via
**Role Mappings**). Again, any user changes require a re-login to become active.
