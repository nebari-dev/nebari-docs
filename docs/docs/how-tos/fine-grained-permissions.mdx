title: Creating and Managing Groups, Roles, and Directories
description: How to configure Keycloak's permissions, groups and roles, and manage group directories in JupyterHub.
---

Groups are a fundamental and vital part of the Nebari ecosystem. They are used to manage access to a wide range of
services within Nebari, including JupyterHub instances, Keycloak realms, Conda environments, and computing resources. By
grouping users based on roles, projects, or departments, Nebari simplifies the management of permissions and resource
sharing.

Beyond managing access, groups play a crucial role in organizing and sharing data across the JupyterHub ecosystem. Each
group can have its own shared directory within JupyterHub, allowing users within the same group to collaborate
seamlessly by sharing files and resources. This facilitates team collaboration and ensures that data is organized and
accessible to those who need it.

In this document, we will cover:

- How to create and manage groups and subgroups in Keycloak
- How to assign roles and permissions to groups
- How groups and roles interact within Nebari's services, such as JupyterHub and Conda-Store
- How to manage group directories in JupyterHub

## Managing Groups in Keycloak

Keycloak is the identity and access management service used in Nebari. It allows you to create and manage users, groups,
roles, and permissions. Groups in Keycloak are collections of users, and they can be assigned specific roles that grant
permissions to access various services within Nebari.

For detailed information on managing groups in Keycloak, refer to the
[Keycloak documentation on Group Management](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_group_management).

Below we outline the steps specific to Nebari.

### Creating a New Group

To create a new group in Keycloak:

1. **Log in to Keycloak** as an administrator (usually the `root` user).
2. **Navigate to Groups**: Click on **Groups** in the left-hand menu.
3. **Create the Group**: Click the **New** button, enter an appropriate name for your new group (e.g.,
   `conda-store-manager`), and save.

If you wish to organize your groups hierarchically, you can create subgroups by selecting a parent group and adding a
subgroup.

## Default Clients and Groups in Nebari

Overview

- **Roles**: Define a set of permissions (or scopes) for a particular client (service).
- **Groups**: Aggregate users who share similar permissions.
- **Scopes**: The individual permissions (e.g., `read:users:name`) that can be attached to a role.

By creating custom roles with specific scopes, and assigning them to groups or users, you can fine-tune exactly who can
do what in your Nebari environment. More details on how to create roles and scopes can be found in the
[Creating a Role](#creating-a-role) section.

## Default Clients and permissions in Nebari

A fresh Nebari deployment comes with several custom Keycloak clients (services) enabled. You can manage these from
**Clients** in the Keycloak admin console:

```yaml
clients:
  - jupyterhub
  - conda_store
  - grafana (if monitoring is enabled)
  - argo-server-sso (if argo is enabled)
  - forwardauth
````

To manage and configure these clients, you can navigate to the `Clients` tab within the Keycloak admin console, as
illustrated in the image below.

![Keycloak clients](/img/how-tos/fine_grainer_permissions_keycloak_clients.png)

This can be accessed at `<nebari-url>/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/nebari/clients`

Groups represent a collection of users that perform similar actions and therefore require similar permissions. By
default, Nebari is deployed with the following groups: `admin`, `developer`, and `analyst` (in roughly descending order
of permissions and scope).

Roles on the other hand represent the type or category of user. This includes access and permissions that this category
of user will need to perform their regular job duties. The differences between `groups` and `roles` are subtle.
Particular roles (one or many), like `conda_store_admin`, are associated with a particular group, such as `admin` and
any user in this group will then assume the role of `conda_store_admin`.

:::info Shared Folders
Membership in one of the default groups also grants access to the corresponding shared folder (e.g., the `developer`
group has access to `~/shared/developer`). Since `2024.9.1`, Nebari requires a special role to access the shared folders:
`allow-group-directory-creation-role`.
:::

## In-depth Look at Default Roles and Groups

:::tip Technical Note
Roles in Nebari can stack, meaning that if a user is in one group with role `conda_store_admin` and another group with
role `conda_store_viewer`, this user ultimately has the role `conda_store_admin`. Also, in case of different level of
access originating from different groups, precedence is given to the highest level of access.

## Roles, Groups, and Scopes in Nebari (via Keycloak)

Nebari uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to manage access for core services like `jupyterhub` and `conda-store`.
Access is expressed through three related concepts:

- **Roles**: Named permission bundles for a specific client/service (e.g., `conda_store_admin`, `jupyterhub_developer`).
- **Groups**: Collections of users who should receive the same roles (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `analyst`).
- **Scopes**: Fine-grained permission strings attached to roles (e.g., `read:users:name` for JupyterHub, or
  `admin!namespace=analyst` for Conda-Store).

Nebari ships with **default clients, groups, and roles** that cover most needs. When you need more granular control,
create **custom roles with specific scopes** in Keycloak and assign them to a group (or directly to a user).

:::note
Creating or editing a role does nothing until it is assigned via **Role Mappings** (to a group or user). Users must log
out and back in for changes to take effect.
:::

**Typical Workflow**:

1. **Create or edit** a role (and define its scopes) under the relevant **Client** (e.g., `jupyterhub`, `conda_store`).
2. **Assign** this role to a **group** (or directly to an individual user).
3. **Add users** to that group if you haven’t already.

### Granting Permissions to a User (via a Group)

Let’s say you have someone who only needs *administrator-level privileges for Conda-Store*, while leaving other services
at their default access.

As an example, we create a new group named `conda-store-manager`. This group will have administrator access to the
Conda-Store service.

1. Click **New** in the upper-right hand corner under **Groups**.

![Keycloak groups tab screenshot - user groups view](/img/how-tos/keycloak_groups.png)

* Then, give the new group an appropriate name.

![Keycloak add group form - name field set to conda-store-manager](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group1.png)

2. Under **Role Mapping**, add the appropriate **Client Roles** as needed; there should be no need to update the **Realm
   Roles**.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused with expanded client roles dropdown](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group2.png)

In this example, the new group only has one mapped role, `conda_store_admin`; however, it's possible to attach multiple
**Client Roles** to a single group.

![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group3.png)

Once complete, return to the **Users** section in the dashboard and add the relevant users to this newly created group.

### Creating Custom Roles with Scopes

Beyond Nebari’s default roles, you can also create your own with highly specific permissions.

#### Components and Syntax

In Nebari, **scopes** are closely tied to the service (client) you’re working with—in Keycloak roles we identify them as
“components.”

* **Components**: Specifies the service that a role’s scopes apply to (e.g., `jupyterhub` or `conda-store`).
* **Scopes**: The actual permission strings recognized by that service.

<div style={{'border-radius': '15px', 'border': '2px solid var(--ifm-color-background-3)', 'padding': '20px', 'margin-bottom': '20px'}}>

#### JupyterHub Scopes

JupyterHub scopes syntax in Nebari follow [JupyterHub’s built-in RBAC syntax](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html). For example:

```
shares!user,read:users:name,read:groups:name
```

* `shares!user`: Allows sharing servers with other users.
* `read:users:name`: Grants read access to other users’ names.
* `read:groups:name`: Grants read access to other groups’ names.

This combination allows a user to share their server with others (via `shares!user`) and also read other users’ and
groups’ names.

For a complete list of JupyterHub scopes, see the JupyterHub documentation:
[https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#available-scopes](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#available-scopes)

Nebari extends these scopes for some integrations (e.g., `jhub-apps`) to support sharing apps with users/groups.

---

#### Conda-Store Scopes

Conda-Store scopes are defined at the namespace level. For example:

```
admin!namespace=analyst,developer!namespace=nebari-git
```

* `admin!namespace=analyst`: Grants an **admin** role in the `analyst` namespace.
* `developer!namespace=nebari-git`: Grants a **developer** role in the `nebari-git` namespace.

Conda-store scopes follow a simple syntax:

```
<access_level>!namespace=<namespace_name>
```

See:
[Conda-Store role mappings](https://conda.store/conda-store/explanations/conda-store-concepts#role-mappings)

</div>

:::note Conda-Store defaults and Nebari’s internal group handling
Nebari grants some Conda-Store permissions **automatically**, regardless of how your
Keycloak groups are configured. The authentication class applies these defaults at
login so users can work even if the Keycloak groups don’t define any `conda_store_*`
client roles.

**What Nebari applies by default**

* **Personal namespace** → always **admin**
  `"{username}/*" → {"admin"}` (cannot be downgraded by scopes).
* **Deployment default namespace** → **viewer**
  `"{default_namespace}/*" → {"viewer"}`.
* **Nebari default groups** (`analyst`, `developer`, `admin`) → **handled internally**
  If a user is in one of these groups, Nebari binds a **same-named namespace** to the
  user with that group’s effective Conda-Store role (e.g., group `analyst` ⇒ `analyst/*`),
  **even when the Keycloak group itself has no client roles**.
* **SuperAdmin** (`conda_store_superadmin`) → full wildcard
  `"*/*" → {"admin"}` (includes delete & service-token privileges).

**How it reconciles with Keycloak scopes**

* On each login, Nebari re-applies permissions from Keycloak role **scopes**
  (e.g., `admin!namespace=analyst`).
* If multiple grants target the same namespace, the **highest** permission wins.
* Order of precedence (highest → lowest): **SuperAdmin** → **explicit scopes** → **internal defaults**.
* Changes take effect after the user signs in again.
  :::

### Creating a Role

In the following example, we create a new role for the `JupyterHub` client granting the same level of permission outlined
in the section above [JupyterHub Scopes](#jupyterhub-scopes).

1. Select the appropriate client and click on **Add Role**.

![Keycloak client add jupyterhub role](/img/how-tos/keycloak_jupyterhub_client.png)

2. On the **Add Role** form, write a meaningful name and description for the role. Click **Save**.

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_jupyterhub_add_role.png)

3. Now the role has been created, but it does nothing. Add permissions by clicking on the **Attributes** tab and adding
   `components` and `scopes`.

![Keycloak clients add jupyterhub role attributes](/img/how-tos/keycloak_add_role_attributes.png)

### Adding Role to Group(s) / User(s)

Creating a role in Keycloak has no effect on any user or group’s permissions until it is assigned.

To add a role to a user:

1. Select **Users** on the left sidebar and search for the user.

![Keycloak select user](/img/how-tos/keycloak_select_user.png)

2. Select that user and click on the **Role Mappings** tab.

![Keycloak user role mapping tab](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_tab.png)

3. Select the client associated with the role.

![Keycloak user role mapping roles](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_roles.png)

4. Select the role in **Available Roles** and click **Add Selected >>**.

![Keycloak user role mapping add role](/img/how-tos/keycloak_user_role_mapping_add_role.png)

To attach a role to a group, follow the above steps but select the group under **Groups** and use the group’s **Role
Mappings** tab.

### Adding Users to a Group

To add users to a group:

1. **Navigate to Users**: Click on **Users** in the left-hand menu.
2. **Select a User**: Choose the user you want to add to a group.
3. **Assign to Group**:

   * Click on the **Groups** tab within the user's details.
   * Click the **Join** button.
   * Select the group (and subgroup, if applicable) you wish to add the user to.
   * Click **Join** to add the user to the group.

Repeat this process for all users who should be part of the group.

### Managing Subgroups

Subgroups allow you to create a hierarchical structure of groups, representing organizational units, projects, or teams.

To manage subgroups:

* **Creating Subgroups**: Select the parent group, navigate to the **Sub Groups** tab, and create a new subgroup.
* **Assigning Roles to Subgroups**: Assign roles to subgroups as needed.
* **Use Cases**: Organize groups hierarchically to reflect organizational structures.

For more information, see the
[Keycloak documentation on Group Hierarchies](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#group-hierarchies).

## Managing Group Directories in JupyterHub

:::note Important
As of version `2024.9.1`, JupyterHub creates and mounts directories only for groups with the
`allow-group-directory-creation-role`. By default, this includes the `admin`, `analyst`, and `developer` groups.
Previously, directories were automatically created for all Keycloak groups. This change gives administrators more
control over shared directories and overall access management without cluttering the file system.
:::

### Understanding Group Directories

A group directory in JupyterHub is a shared folder accessible to all members of a specific group. It provides a shared
space within the file system for collaboration.

An example directory structure:

```yaml
/shared
├── admin
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
├── analyst
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
└── developer
    ├── file1.txt
    └── file2.txt
```

### Assigning the `allow-group-directory-creation-role` to a Group

To enable directory creation and mounting for a group in JupyterHub, assign the `allow-group-directory-creation-role` to
the group in Keycloak.

1. **Navigate to the Group**: Log in to Keycloak as an administrator and select the group.
2. **Go to Role Mappings**: Click on the **Role Mappings** tab.
3. **Assign the Role**:

   * Under **Client Roles**, select the `jupyterhub` client.
   * Select `allow-group-directory-creation-role` and click **Add selected**.

Users in this group will now have access to the group's shared directory in JupyterHub.

### Rolling Back the Change

To remove the group's directory access:

1. **Navigate to the Group's Role Mappings**: Select the group and go to the **Role Mappings** tab.
2. **Remove the Role**:

   * Under **Assigned Roles**, select `allow-group-directory-creation-role`.
   * Click **Remove selected**.

**Data Preservation:** No data is deleted when you remove the role; the directory is simply unmounted from users'
JupyterLab sessions.

### Managing Subgroup Directories

Subgroups can have their own directories in JupyterHub if assigned the `allow-group-directory-creation-role`. Assign the
role to subgroups as needed to control access and collaboration.

## Components and Scopes

When specifying fine-grained permissions in Keycloak, we use the `components` and `scopes` attributes. These attributes
define the permissions that a role grants to a user or group. This model follows the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
model and is based upon the same structure utilized by
[JupyterHub RBAC](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rbac/index.html).

### Components Attribute

The value of the `component` attribute depends on the service we are creating a role for. Currently, Nebari supports:

* `jupyterhub`: to create `jupyterhub` native roles in the `jupyterhub` client.
* `conda-store`: to create `conda-store` roles in the `conda_store` client.

### JupyterHub Scopes

The syntax for the `scopes` attribute for a `jupyterhub` role in Keycloak in Nebari follows the native RBAC scopes
syntax for JupyterHub itself. Documentation:
[https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#scope-conventions](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#scope-conventions)

Example (sharing apps via `jhub-apps`):

> `shares!user,read:users:name,read:groups:name`

* `shares!user`: grants permissions to share user's server
* `read:users:name`: grants permissions to read other user's names
* `read:groups:name`: grants permissions to read other groups's names

### Conda Store Scopes

Conda-Store scopes are applied at the namespace level.

Example:

> `admin!namespace=analyst,developer!namespace=nebari-git`

* `admin!namespace=analyst`: grants `admin` access to namespace `analyst`
* `developer!namespace=nebari-git`: grants `developer` access to namespace `nebari-git`

When attached to a user or a group, the above-mentioned permissions will be granted to the user/group.

To make these new permissions effective, assign the custom role to a user or group (via **Role Mappings**). Any changes
require a re-login to become active.
