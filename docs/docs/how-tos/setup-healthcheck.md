description: Set up healthchecks with Kuberhealthy
---

:::warning

This feature is in beta status. It should be used with caution.

:::

# Overview

Nebari integrates [Kuberhealthy](https://kuberhealthy.github.io/kuberhealthy/) to perform internal healthchecks on Nebari. This is an extensible Kubernetes native framework for continuous synthetic testing. Kuberhealthy is set up to export metrics to Prometheus. This allows them to be seen in Grafana.

## Enabling

Healthchecks are currently considered a beta feature that we are testing. Due to this, they are disabled by default. To enable healthchecks, add the following configuration under the `monitoring` configuration in your `nebari-config.yaml`.

```yaml
monitoring:
  healthchecks:
    enabled: true
```

## Checking status of Healthchecks

All healthchecks are exported as metrics to Prometheus and can be viewed in Grafana.

For example: To see the uptime for the conda-store service, you can run:

```
1 - (sum(count_over_time(kuberhealthy_check{check="dev/conda-store-http-check", status="0"}[30d])) OR vector(0))/(sum(count_over_time(kuberhealthy_check{check="dev/conda-store-http-check", status="1"}[30d])) * 100)
```

in Grafana, which will show you the following chart.

To see what other healthchecks are available, you can use the metric explorer in Grafana. Select the metric type of `kuberhealthy_check` and the label filter of `check`. The values list will be a list of the checks that
have metrics available.

:::note

If you have previously deployed Nebari without healthchecks, You may need to restart your Prometheus service to get it to pick up the kuberhealthy metrics.

## Summary of available healthchecks
