title: Nebari Extension System
description: An overview of the pluggy extension system for Nebari
---

:::warning
The Extension System was added recently in release 2023.9.1. It's in active development and might be unstable.

We don't recommend using it in productions systems yet, but we'll appreciate your explorations, testing, and feedback. You can share your comments in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues/1894).
:::

## Introduction

This guide is to help developers extend and modify the behavior of
Nebari. We leverage the plugin system
[pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to enable easy
extensibility. Currently, Nebari supports:

 - overriding a given stages in a deployment
 - adding additional stages before, after and between existing stages
 - arbitrary subcommands

We maintain an [examples
repository](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-plugin-examples)
which contains up to date usable examples.

## Installing a plugin

Registering a plugin should be easy for the end user. Plugins are
either installed into your existing environment e.g.

```shell
pip install my-nebari-plugin
```

Alternatively if you only want to temporarily add an extension.

:::note
`--import-plugin` does not work for loading subcommands due to
cli already being constructed before plugin imports take place.
:::

```shell
nebari --import-plugin path/to/plugin.py <command> ...
nebari --import-plugin import.module.plugin.path <command> ...
```

:::note
Currently, Nebari does **not** support un-installing a plugin.
You will need to destroy and re-deploy Nebari to remove any installed plugins.

## Developing an extension

The most important step to developing a plugin is ensuring that the
setuptools entrypoint is set.

<!-- Note: FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer, tool used by Docusaurus to generate code blocks & highlight syntax does not support TOML, so we're using YAML highlighting below -->

```yaml title="pyproject.toml"
...

[project.entry-points.nebari]
my-subcommand = "path.to.subcommand.module"

...
```

Adding this one line to your `pyproject.toml` will ensure that upon
installation of the package the Nebari plugins are registered.

### Subcommands

Nebari exposes a hook `nebari_subcommand` which exposes the
[typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) CLI instance. This allows
the developer to attach any arbitrary number of subcommands.

```python
from nebari.hookspecs import hookimpl

import typer


@hookimpl
def nebari_subcommand(cli):
    @cli.command()
    def hello(
        name: str = typer.Option(
            "Nebari", help="Who to say hello to"
        )
    ):
        print(f"Hello {name}")
```

There is a dedicated working example in [nebari-plugin-examples](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-plugin-examples/tree/main/examples/nebari_subcommand_hello_world).

### Stages

Nebari exposes a hook `nebari_stage` which uses the `NebariStage`
class. `NebriStage` exposes `render`, `deploy`, `destroy` as
arbitrary functions calls. See below for a complete example.

Nebari decides the order of stages based on two things the `name: str`
attribute and `priority: int` attribute. The rules are as follows:
 - stages are ordered by `priority`
 - stages which have the same `name` the one with highest priority
   number is chosen

```python
import contextlib
import os
from typing import Dict, Any

from nebari.hookspecs import hookimpl, NebariStage


class HelloWorldStage(NebariStage):
    name = "hello_world"
    priority = 100

    def render(self):
        return {
            "hello_world.txt": "File that says hello world"
        }

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def deploy(self, stage_outputs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]):
        print("I ran deploy")
        # set environment variables for stages that run after
        os.environ['HELLO'] = 'WORLD'
        # set output state for future stages to use
        stage_outputs[self.name] = {'hello': 'world'}
        yield
        # cleanup after deployment (rarely needed)
        os.environ.pop('HELLO')

    def check(self, stage_outputs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]):
        if 'HELLO' not in os.environ:
            raise ValueError('stage did not deploy successfully since HELLO environment variable not set')

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def destroy(self, stage_outputs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]], status: Dict[str, bool]):
        print('faking to destroy things for hello world stage')
        yield


@hookimpl
def nebari_stage():
    return [HelloWorldStage]
```
