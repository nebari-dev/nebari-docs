# Using GPUs on Nebari
## Introduction
Overview of using GPUs on Nebari including server setup, environment setup, and validation.

## 1. Starting a GPU server

Follow Steps 1 to 3 in the [Authenticate and launch JupyterLab][login-with-keycloak] tutorial. The UI will show a list of profiles (instances, servers, machines).

![Nebari select profile](/img/how-tos/nebari_select_profile.png)
Your administrator pre-configures these options, as described in [Profile Configuration documentation][profile-configuration].

Select an appropriate profile and click "Start".

### Understanding GPU setup on the server.
The following steps describe how to get CUDA-related information from the server.
1. Once your server starts, it will redirect you to a JupyterLab home page.
2. Click on the **"Terminal"** icon.
3. Run the command `nvidia-smi`. The top right corner of the command's output should have the highest supported driver.

    If you get the error `nvidia-smi: command not found`, you are most likely on a non-GPU server. Shutdown your server, and start up a GPU-enabled server.

## 2. Creating environments

By default, `conda-store` will build CPU-compatible packages. To build GPU-compatible packages, we the following.
### Build a GPU-compatible environments
By default, `conda-store` will build CPU-compatible packages. To build GPU-compatible packages, we have two options:
1. **Create environment specification using `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` (recommended approach)**:

    Conda-store provides an alternate mechanism to enable GPU environments via the setting of an environment variable as explained in the [conda-store docs](https://conda.store/conda-store-ui/tutorials/create-envs#set-environment-variables).
    While creating a new config, click on the **GUI <-> YAML** Toggle to edit yaml config.
    ```
    channels:
      - pytorch
      - nvidia
      - conda-forge
    dependencies:
      - pytorch
      - ipykernel
    variables:
      CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA: "12.1"
    ```

    Add the `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` override to the variables section to tell conda-store to build a GPU-compatible environment.

    :::note
    - At the time of writing this document, the latest CUDA version was showing as `12.1`. Please follow the above step to determine the latest override value for the `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` environment variable.
    - Please ensure that your choice from PyTorch documentation is not greater than the highest supported version in the `nvidia-smi` output (captured above).
    :::

2. **Creating config using PyTorch documentation**:

You will need to check PyTorch documentation to [select a supported version of CUDA from the support matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to determine the latest override version for `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA`.
Select the following options to get the latest CUDA version:
 - PyTorch Build = Stable
 - Your OS          = Linux
 - Package          = Conda
 - Language         = Python
 - Compute Platform = 12.1 (Choose the latest supported platform)

![pytorch-linux-conda-version](/img/how-tos/pytorch-linux-conda-version.png)

The command `conda install` from above is:
 ```
 conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    ```
The corresponding yaml config would be:
 ```
 channels:
   - pytorch
   - nvidia
   - conda-forge
 dependencies:
   - pytorch
   - pytorch-cuda==12.1
   - torchvision
   - torchaudio
   - ipykernel
 variables: {}
    ```
You can use **GUI <-> YAML** Toggle to edit the config.


## 3. Validating the setup
You can check that your GPU server is compatible with your conda environment by opening a Jupyter Noteboo, loading the environment, and running the following code:
```
import torch
print(f"GPU available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
print(f"ID of current GPU: {torch.cuda.current_device()}")
print(f"Name of first GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
```
Your output should look something like this:
