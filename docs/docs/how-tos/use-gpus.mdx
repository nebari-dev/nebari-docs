# Using GPUs on Nebari
## Introduction
Overview of using GPUs on Nebari including server setup, environment setup, and validation.

## 1. Starting a GPU server

  Follow Steps 1 to 3 in the [Authenticate and launch JupyterLab][login-with-keycloak] tutorial. The UI will show a list of profiles (a.k.a, instances, servers, or machines).

  ![Nebari select profile](/img/how-tos/nebari_select_profile.png)
  Your administrator pre-configures these options, as described in [Profile Configuration documentation][profile-configuration].

  Select an appropriate GPU Instance and click "Start".

  ### Understanding GPU setup on the server.
  The following steps describe how to get CUDA-related information from the server.
  1. Once your server starts, it will redirect you to a JupyterLab home page.
  2. Click on the **"Terminal"** icon.
  3. Run the command `nvidia-smi`. The top right corner of the command's output should have the highest supported driver.

  If you get the error `nvidia-smi: command not found`, you are most likely on a non-GPU server. Shutdown your server, and start up a GPU-enabled server.

  **Compatible environments for this server must contain CUDA versions *below* the GPU server version. For example, the server in this case is on 12.4. All environments used on this server must contain packages build with `CUDA<=12.4`.**

## 2. Creating environments

  ### Build a GPU-compatible environment
  Create the environment specification using `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA`:

    Conda-store provides an alternate mechanism to enable GPU environments via the setting of an environment variable as explained in the [conda-store docs](https://conda.store/conda-store-ui/tutorials/create-envs#set-environment-variables).
    While creating a new config, click on the `**GUI <-> YAML**` Toggle to edit yaml config.
    ```
    channels:
      - conda-forge
    dependencies:
      - pytorch
      - ipykernel
    variables:
      CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA: "12.1"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can configure the same config using the UI.

    Add the `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` override to the variables section to tell conda-store to build a GPU-compatible environment.

:::note
At the time of writing this document, the latest CUDA version was showing as `12.1`. Please follow the steps below to determine the latest override value for the `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` environment variable.

Please ensure that your choice from PyTorch documentation is not greater than the highest supported version in the `nvidia-smi` output (captured above).

## 3. Validating the setup
  You can check that your GPU server is compatible with your conda environment by opening a Jupyter Notebook, loading the environment, and running the following code:
  ```
  import torch
  print(f"GPU available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
  print(f"Number of GPUs available: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
  print(f"ID of current GPU: {torch.cuda.current_device()}")
  print(f"Name of first GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
  ```
  Your output should look something like this:
