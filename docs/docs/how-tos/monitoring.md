# Monitoring

In Nebari, we've integrated Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki to provide robust monitoring capabilities for
your data science platform. This integration allows you to visualize metrics, monitor system health, and
analyze logs effectively. Below, we'll discuss each component and how they are deployed using Helm charts,
along with instructions on how to override configuration values.

Monitoring is enabled by default in Nebari. It can be disabled by setting the following in your `nebari-config.yaml`.

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: false
```

## Components Overview

### Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a leading open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
It provides rich visualization tools and dashboards for analyzing and monitoring metrics from various data sources.

### Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It collects
metrics from configured targets, stores them efficiently, and allows querying them in real-time.

### Loki

[Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) is a horizontally-scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log
aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate, as it
does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream. Below is a step-by-step
walkthrough of how to view JupyterHub pod logs in Grafana Loki:

Go to explore section of monitoring of your Nebari installation at:

https://{your-nebari-domain}/monitoring/

![Grafana Explore Page](/img/how-tos/1_grafana-explore.png)

Select Loki Data source at the top:

![Grafana Select Loki](/img/how-tos/2_grafana-select-loki.png)

Click on the Log browser and select labels to search in, in this case we have selected pod:

![Grafana Select Loki](/img/how-tos/3_grafana-log-browser-pod.png)

Type the pod name initials for the pod you're looking to search logs for, in this case we are looking
for hub pod:

![Grafana Select Loki](/img/how-tos/4_grafana-log-search-pod.png)

Select the pod from the list of pods and then click on "Show logs":

![Grafana Select Loki](/img/how-tos/5_grafana-log-select-pod.png)

After clicking on "Show logs", you should be able to see logs for JupyterHub pod as shown below:

![Grafana Select Loki](/img/how-tos/6_grafana-view-pod-logs.png)

You can also filter by time, by clicking on the time filter on top right, next to "Run query".

## Terraform Overrides

Nebari provides its users with the ability to customize the deployment of various component
and Loki is one of them. Loki deployment is made up of three fundamental components:

- Loki: a set of components that when composed forms a fully featured logging stack
- Promtail: an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a Loki instance
- MinIO: a Kubernetes-native high-performance object storage server which is designed for large-scale
  private cloud infrastructure and compatible with Amazon S3.

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  overrides:
    loki: <LOKI-HELM-CHART-VALUES-OVERRIDE>
    promtail: <PROMTAIL-HELM-CHART-VALUES-OVERRIDE>
    minio: <MINIO-HELM-CHART-VALUES-OVERRIDE>
```

Below are some examples of customizing your loki deployment via terraform overrides:

### Log Storage Config

We use minio for logs storage as default, it is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. You can use
any S3 compatible object store instead of minio, below is an example configuration for using AWS S3:

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  minio_enabled: false
  overrides:
    loki:
      loki:
        storage_config:
          aws:
            s3: s3://<access_key>:<uri-encoded-secret-access-key>@<region>
```

See https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/storage/#aws-deployment-s3-single-store for more configuration
options.

### Log Storage

You can customize the size of persistent volume for logs storage, by setting up the value for
`minio.persistence.size` as shown below:

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  overrides:
    minio:
      persistence:
        size: 100Gi
```

### Log Retention Period

Since the storage for MinIO is predefined and is not infinitely scalable out-of-the-box like
cloud storage solutions like S3, GCS, etc, unless you keep increasing minio persistent volume size.
It is a good idea to clear up old logs to make space for new ones, Nebari does this by default with
60 days retention period. You can customize the log retention period by overriding the default
value as follows:

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  overrides:
    loki:
      loki:
        limits_config:
          # The minimum retention period is 24h.
          retention_period: 90d
```

This may not be a suitable solution for many cases, like if your organization needs to keep
all the logs forever, then you may want to use a very large persistent volume and disable
deletion of old logs. You can disable deletion via:

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  overrides:
    loki:
      loki:
        compactor:
          retention_enabled: false
```
