# Nebari Slurm - Deploy Nebari on HPC systems

Nebari Slurm is an opinionated open source deployment of jupyterhub based on an HPC jobscheduler.
Nebari Slurm is a "distribution" of these packages much like Debian and Ubuntu are distributions of Linux.
The high level goal of this distribution is to form a cohesive set of tools that enable:

* environment management via conda and conda-store
* monitoring of compute infrastructure and services
* scalable and efficient compute via jupyterlab and dask
* deployment of jupyterhub on prem without requiring deep devops knowledge of the Slurm/HPC and jupyter ecosystem
