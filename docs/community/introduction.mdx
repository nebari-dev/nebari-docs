Thanks for being part of the Nebari community!

Open source doesn't always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming.
The Nebari team believes that everyone belongs in open source, and Nebari is dedicated to making you feel welcome.

All questions and contributions are welcome. Contributions can include issues, contributing code, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts,
helping out people, organizing community events, working on accessibility and design items, and more.
Continue reading to learn what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.
By contributing to open source projects, you can connect with people, learn new skills, become a subject-matter expert,
and apply all learnings to your projects. We look forward to hearing from you!

  "What is the recommended way to do _X_ with Nebari?"
- [The Nebari issue tracker][nebari-issues] is the preferred channel for bug reports, documentation requests, and submitting pull requests.

1. Code maintenance and development
2. Community coordination and contributor experience
3. DevOps
4. Fundraising
5. Marketing

### Help fellow users

You can also help users on [issues][nebari-issues] and [pull requests][nebari-prs] to contribute or fix their issues.

### Contribute code

The Nebari repo consists of many interconnected pieces, making it difficult to start contributing. To learn how to set up the repository locally, how to contribute to the project, and how to create a pull request:

[Read the Code contributions guide →][code-contributions]

### Contribute documentation

You can help make the docs awesome. We strive to create inclusive, comprehensive, and enjoyable documentation for our users and everyone can help!
Found a typo or an incorrect code example? Put up a PR! Found a better way to explain a concept?
Put up a PR! Contributions to our documentation are valuable and greatly appreciated.

### Help triage issues

[Triaging an issue][nebari-issues] means gathering missing information, running the given reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the root cause of the problem.
You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although it would undoubtedly be much appreciated), but sharing your investigation results can save us a ton of time.

[Best practices for creating and triaging issues →][community-issues]

## Community meetings

We have a:
* bi-weekly 1-hour community meeting to chat about everything Nebari, and
* weekly 30-minute triage meeting where we triage and follow-up on open issues and PRs.

The embedded Google Calendar below shows the meeting schedules.
