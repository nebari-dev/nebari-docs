    - Update any references, if relevant. This includes Guides and Nebari Internals docs.

We want to ensure that the content produced for Nebari is accessible; if you are making significant contributions,
please address the access-centred guidelines in your content and complete our checklist. Thanks to @isabela-pf for this checklist :)

### Access-centered content checklist

#### Text styling

- [ ] The content is written with [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) (where relevant).
- [ ] If there are headers, they use the proper header tags (with only one level-one header: `H1` or `#` in markdown).
- [ ] All links describe where they link to (for example, check the [Nebari website](https://nebari.dev/)).
- [ ] This content adheres to the Nebari style guides.

#### Non-text content

- [ ] All content is represented as text (for example, images need alt text, and videos need captions or descriptive transcripts).
- [ ] If there are emojis, there are not more than three in a row.
- [ ] Don't use [flashing GIFs or videos](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html).
- [ ] If the content were to be read as plain text, it still makes sense, and no information is missing.

## Any other comments?

<!--
Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers, so patience is necessary;
assistance handling other issues is very welcome.
We value all user contributions. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc., or the reviewers are likely busy. In either case,
we ask for your understanding during the
review process.
Thanks for contributing to Nebari 🙏🏼!
