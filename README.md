## Documentation

### Installing  `node`
- Checking if node is already present in the system (should print the version number)
    ```bash
     node -v
    ```
- To install node visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Building the site

Install the necessary packages
```bash
cd docs
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.
