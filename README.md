## Nebari 101 :zap:

Nebari Cloud can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster by leveraging these tools:

- [Terraform modules](https://www.terraform.io/): to automate the provisioning of your cloud infrastructure
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/): to define, manage, and install Kubernetes applications
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) or
  [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html): to automate the build and deployment of Nebari.

Nebari aims to abstract all these complexities for its users. Hence, it is not necessary to know any of the above
mentioned technologies to have your project successfully deployed.

> **TLD;R**
> If you know GitHub/GitLab and feel comfortable generating and using API keys, you should have all it takes to deploy
> and maintain your system without the need for a dedicated DevOps team. No need to learn Kubernetes, Terraform, or Helm.

### Nebari on-prem

We also have a version of Nebari based on OpenHPC. It can be used to deploy onto HPC systems or on bare-metal.

> **Note**
> This tool is currently under development. Curious? Check out the [Nebari HPC](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-hpc) repository.

## Installation :computer:

Nebari is supported by macOS and Linux operating systems (Windows is **NOT** currently supported).
It is compatible with `Python 3.7+`. We also suggest you use virtual environments such as ([`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),
[`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

Depending on where you are planning to deploy, Nebari can be installed and
deployed in roughly 30 minutes!

> **\*Note**
> Check the [Nebari installation guide](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started/installing-nebari) for detailed step-by-step instructions on deploying Nebari.
